pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/20993/moreinfo\n\nThis message is being issued for Victoria. \n- Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) has been found in New South Wales. \n- This message is relevant for all beekeepers, associated beekeeping businesses and orchard owners.  \n- Restrictions are now in place for the movement of bees, beehives, beekeeping equipment and bee products. \n- Victoria is currently free from Varroa mite. \n- An Order declaring Victoria as a Control Area is now in place to prevent Varroa mite from coming into Victoria from NSW.  \n\n\n- You must have a permit to bring bees, beehives, beekeeping equipment and bee products into Victoria’s Sunraysia region. \n- Check your hives regularly for signs of Varroa mite and other exotic pests. \n- If you already have bees in the Sunraysia region, you must still apply for a permit. \n- To view a map of the Sunraysia region, visit: <a
