Bird      owners who reside in the control area no longer need to house all their      poultry in cages or sheds.  \n- No further cases of avian influenza have been detected in Victoria since 24 June 2024.\nThings you should know about avian influenza:  \n- Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease that infects chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many species of wild birds, including waterfowl and seabirds can also carry the virus. \n- Movement controls remain in place and infected properties have been quarantined. These controls prohibit the movement of birds, equipment and products within and out of the control area until further notice.
