This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in the east and south Gippsland which may cause minor flooding in several catchments.\n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Tuesday, widespread rainfall totals of 30 to 115 mm have been observed across Victoria.\n\nCatchments across the Flood Watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during the past few days.\n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the Flood Watch area during Tuesday and into Wednesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible.\n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations in the Flood Watch area from Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.\n\nA Severe Thunderstorm Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of North Central and parts of Central, Northern Country, North East, West and South Gippsland and South West Forecast Districts.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in the east and south Gippsland which may cause minor flooding in several catchments. \n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Tuesday, widespread rainfall totals of 30 to 115 mm have been observed across Victoria. \n\nCatchments across the Flood Watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during the past few days. \n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the Flood Watch area during Tuesday and into Wednesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations in the Flood Watch area from Tuesday afternoon. \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop and catchments may respond quickly. \n\nA Severe Thunderstorm Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of North Central and parts of Central, Northern Country, North East, West and South Gippsland and South West Forecast Districts. \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for Central and South West Forecast Districts. \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast. \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.\n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:
