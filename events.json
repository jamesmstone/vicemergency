ANIMAL DISEASE - Stay Informed\nIncident Location: Terang and surrounds\nIssue Date: Friday 23 August 2024, 04:33 pm\nNext Update: Friday 06 September 2024, 06:00 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/34080/moreinfo\n\nThis message is being issued for Terang and surrounds.\n-   An      outbreak of high pathogenicity H7N9 avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed      in poultry at Terang.  \n-   This      warning remains relevant for all bird owners including poultry producers,      bird keepers and pet bird owners. \n-   No      further cases of avian influenza have been detected in Victoria since 24      June 2024.  \n- This Community Information replaces the Community Information issued on 15 August. \n\n\nThings you should know about avian influenza: \n-   Avian      influenza is a highly contagious disease that infects chickens, ducks,      geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many species      of wild birds, including waterfowl and seabirds can also carry the      virus.  \n- Movement      controls remain in place and infected properties have been      quarantined.   \n- In      this area, you cannot move birds, equipment and products within and out of      the control area and restricted area until further notice. You can find      more information about movement controls and quarantine here:  <a href=\"http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu</a> \n- To      stop the spread of avian influenza, birds on infected properties were      humanely disposed of. \n- Chicken      meat and eggs are safe to eat.  \n- While      cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly      pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the      public remains low.  \n\n\nAll bird owners should regularly check their birds. If you suspect your birds are sick you should contact your local vet or call the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226.
