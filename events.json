The highest risk period is during the afternoon or with approaching showers. Coastal locations are at higher risk, especially the most southern coasts where thunderstorms are possible.\n\nWinds are expected to rapidly ease inland in the evening then contract to the Gippsland coast by tonight before easing below warning threshold early Thursday.\n\nLocations which may be affected include Horsham, Warrnambool, Maryborough, Ballarat, Geelong, Melbourne, Mornington Peninsula, Bass Coast, Traralgon and Bairnsdale.\n\nSevere weather is no longer occurring in the Northern Country district and the warning for this district is CANCELLED. \n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has also issued a Coastal Hazard Warning for people in parts of Central, East Gippsland, South West and West and South Gippsland Forecast Districts.\n- Damaging surf conditions are forecast along the South West and about the exposed Bass and Wilsons Promontory coasts today. These conditions may produce localised damage and coastal erosion.\n- Beach conditions in these areas will be dangerous and people should stay well away from the surf and surf exposed area. \n- Abnormally high tides which may cause seawater flooding of low-lying areas are likely along the Gippsland coast on the afternoon high tide today. \n- At Lakes Entrance, water levels may exceed the highest tide of the year by 0.3-0.5m during this afternoon's high tide.\n- Water levels around other parts of Victoria, including Port Phillip, Central and the South West coast, may also exceed the highest tides of the year and lead to minor inundation of low-lying coastal areas.\n\n\nLocations which may be affected include Warrnambool, Portland, Nelson, Southbank, Elwood Canal, Lakes Entrance, Bairnsdale and Mallacoota.\n\nStay informed and be aware of potential hazards caused by the severe weather. Hazards include debris, damaged buildings, trees down and fallen power lines.\n\nFor coastal areas, stay informed and be aware of potential hazards. Stay well away from the surf and surf-exposed areas. Never enter floodwater.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"34117","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"34117","category1":"Met","category2":"Severe
