pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/19930/moreinfo\n\nThis Advice message is being issued for The Honeysuckles.\n\n-  Due to a whale carcass there could be an increase in shark activity at The Honeysuckles near Ninety Mile Beach.\n- A whale carcass can attract sharks to the area and mean they are closer to the shore than normal.\n- While it is not uncommon for sharks to be present off the Victorian coast, you should exercise additional caution in the area.\n- The Victorian Fisheries Authority is assisting Wildlife Officers and Park Rangers with the management of a whale carcass.\n- This Advice message replaces the Advice issued on 19 January. \n\n\nStay informed and do not enter the water at closed beaches.
