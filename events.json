Catchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.     \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 30 to 60 mm are likely in the western and central and Gippsland catchments of Flood Watch area on Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals of 60 to 80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.    \n\nIsolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms. Rainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.    \n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is

Isolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nRainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"32056","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"32056","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Dandenong Creek","created":"2024-01-08T07:46:41+11:00","updated":"2024-01-08T07:46:40+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[147.57207371796906,-36.93637995068089]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[146.07415654266623,-36.18644959138627],[145.98077275360674,-36.57562734675361],[145.67315556610666,-37.3481201814357],[145.4589221676661,-37.59226629028825],[145.47471501436092,-37.68035482562774],[145.73907353485347,-37.94832510223437],[145.98077275360674,-37.761825133470964],[146.36186101045735,-37.890907387863386],[147.30668522920948,-37.762910798846775],[148.35038640108183,-37.64556689598537],[149.68522526827203,-37.44085878705414],[149.5259235104568,-37.34921189077164],[149.34190251435922,-37.2705682539637],[148.17460515108436,-37.12179485508267],[148.01255681123874,-37.00124910254146],[148.05718876923896,-36.39896981948486],[148.04070927704777,-36.2174781698752],[148.0297229489263,-36.19088299843984],[148.0297229489263,-36.15097330138865],[147.9802844723617,-36.053330738409386],[147.90887333955413,-35.995575842945556],[147.71661259736547,-35.9244347991274],[147.57928349580214,-35.986686717350544],[147.48040654267297,-35.95556689085018],[147.41448857392618,-35.95556689085018],[147.33209111298814,-36.053330738409386],[147.28814580049328,-36.04888955732062],[147.26617314424135,-36.04444812565615],[147.21124150361598,-36.04888955732062],[147.13433720673876,-36.00446396684278],[147.06841923799195,-36.088851164890244],[147.0574329098615,-36.115480956190325],[146.9970081051754,-36.07997256215019],[146.95855595674126,-36.11104328447557],[146.62896611298927,-36.00890765312289],[146.62347294892857,-35.97779659015739],[146.59051396455516,-35.968905461468005],[146.469664355174,-35.9733511509934],[146.44219853486138,-35.97779659015739],[146.37078740205382,-36.04444812565615],[146.07415654266623,-36.18644959138627]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Weather","eventCode":"weather","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"maeve.gill@emv.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"32079","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"32079","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Wodonga, Wangaratta, Corryong, Bright, Falls Creek and Omeo","created":"2024-01-08T10:51:55+11:00","updated":"2024-01-08T10:51:56+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">The\nBureau of Meteorology has issued a <b>Severe Weather Warning</b> for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[location]\" data-value=\"Wodonga, Wangaratta, Corryong, Bright, Falls Creek and Omeo\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Wodonga, Wangaratta, Corryong, Bright, Falls Creek and Omeo</span>.<div><br><div><ul><li>This Advice message is for&nbsp;<span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[insert description of severe weather as per Bureau warning]\" data-value=\"heavy, locally intense rainfall which may lead to flash flooding\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">heavy, locally intense rainfall which may lead to flash flooding</span>&nbsp;which is occurring across this region and will continue during this morning.</li><li>Six-hourly rainfall totals between 40 to 70 mm are likely.</li><li>Locally intense rainfall which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible during this period with six-hourly rainfall totals up to 100 mm.&nbsp;</li><li>Heavy, locally intense rainfall is forecast to ease below warning thresholds during late Monday afternoon. </li><li>This Advice message replaces the Advice issued at 9:24 am Monday 8 January 2024.</li></ul></div></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Stay informed and be\naware of potential hazards caused by the severe weather.
