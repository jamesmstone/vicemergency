People should expect there may be a requirement to be moved to Bendigo from Echuca Emergency Relief Centre (Echuca South Basketball Stadium).\n\nFlood water is impacting sewerage systems in Echuca. Please consider minimising water use, including the use of washing machines and dishwashers, and limit baths and showers. This will reduce the volume of water being sent to sewer while flood levels are high.  \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"24282","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Emergency Warning","id":"24282","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Emergency Warning","location":"Echuca and Echuca Village ","created":"2022-10-20T22:08:47+11:00","updated":"2022-10-20T22:08:47+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.70209593459714,-36.35565660124583]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[144.6727847544821,-36.35158070733955],[144.67312807723476,-36.370864920495684],[144.689607569426,-36.3707958099848],[144.68986506149497,-36.37549518483536],[144.73140711471214,-36.37480411810296],[144.72376818344273,-36.3649211922102],[144.72385401412637,-36.33581801765631],[144.69046587630766,-36.33595630073484],[144.6961307017537,-36.35171896243068],[144.6727847544821,-36.35158070733955]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"k.davis@cfa.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"24263","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"24263","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Rochester Township","created":"2022-10-20T20:03:43+11:00","updated":"2022-10-20T20:03:44+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This&nbsp;<b>Minor Flood Warning </b>is being issued<b>&nbsp;</b>for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"Rochester Township\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Rochester Township</span>.<div><br></div><div><ul><li>This Advice replaces the Emergency Warning issued at 1.59pm.&nbsp;</li><li>Most buildings have been impacted by flood waters and may require electrical inspections.</li></ul><div><b>Energy Safe Safety Information:</b></div></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.esv.vic.gov.au/pdfs/using-a-generator-safely/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Using a Generator&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.esv.vic.gov.au/pdfs/energy-safety-during-floods/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Safety During Floods</a></li></ul></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Stay informed - monitor your\nlocal conditions and remain alert. </div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><b>What you should do:&nbsp;</b><div><b><br></b><div><ul><li>Be prepared to act if your situation changes.</li><li>You should stay informed by listening to emergency\nbroadcasters and monitoring warnings. </li><li>Floodwater is toxic - never play or swim in floodwater.</li></ul></div></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><b>Impacts in your area:&nbsp;</b><div><b><br></b><div><ul><li>Stagnant water can be harmful to your health.
