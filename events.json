The size of the control areas has been reduced to match the former restricted areas. \n- Bird owners who reside in the restricted area no longer need to house all their poultry in cages or sheds. \n- No      further cases of avian influenza have been detected in Victoria since 24      June 2024.\nThings you should know about avian influenza:\n- Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease that infects chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many species of wild birds, including waterfowl and seabirds can also carry the virus. \n- Movement controls remain in place and infected properties have been quarantined. These controls prohibit the movement of birds, equipment and products within and out of the control area until further notice. You can find more information about movement controls and quarantine here: <a href=\"http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu\" title=\"agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu\" target=\"_blank\">agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu</a><a href=\"http://www.agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu\" title=\"Agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianflu.\" target=\"_blank\">.</a>\n- To stop the spread of avian influenza, birds on infected properties were humanely disposed of.         \n- Properly cooked chicken meat and eggs are safe to eat.  \n- While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. \n\n\nAll bird owners should regularly check their birds. If you suspect your birds are sick you should contact the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline 1800 226 226.
