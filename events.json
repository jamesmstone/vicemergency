Isolated totals of 60-80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 60 to 100 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area from late Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms\n\nShowers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.
