The Murray River at Barham is likely to remain above the major flood level (6.10 metres) through to the end of the week. \n\nSome properties remain isolated due to standing water across many areas. Aircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area. Emergency services personnel are assessing impacts on affected properties caused by overtopping and levee breeches. \n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers.

MDBA are working closely with the Bureau and WaterNSW to plan release strategies.\n\n- At Boundary Bend and Wentworth Moderate flooding is currently occurring. \n- The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the major flood level (9.00 metres) around Saturday 12 November. The river level may reach near 9.10 metres around 15-17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- At Euston Minor flooding is currently occurring and may exceed the moderate flood level (9.80 metres, 51.60 metres AHD) around 13-16 November. The river level may exceed the major flood level (10.30 metres, 52.10 metres AHD) around 16-18 November and reach around 10.40 metres (52.24 metres AHD) around 19-22 November, with major flooding.

Further rises are possible.\n- At Echuca and Moama, river levels are slowly receding, with major flooding likely to continue until around Friday. \n- At Torrumbarry, river levels are expected to remain steady due to continuing breakout flows, with major flooding forecast into mid November. Significant breakout flows from Torrumbarry have spilled into the Wakool River. These flows, combined with floodwaters from the Murray and Edward Rivers, have caused major flooding at Wakool Junction and may cause major flooding downstream at Boundary Bend, Euston, Mildura and Wentworth, with levels higher than the 1975 flood event.\n- At Barham, a major flood peak was observed around 26 October following a series of renewed rises. River levels are falling slowly, with major flooding likely to continue through to the end of the week. \n- At Swan Hill the river level peaked on Tuesday with moderate flooding. Moderate flooding is occurring at Wentworth. The Murray River at Swan Hill peaked at 4.60 metres around midday Tuesday and is currently at 4.59 metres and falling slowly with near moderate flooding. The Murray River at Swan Hill may remain around the moderate flood level (4.60 m) through to the weekend.\n- At Wakool Junction, the Murray River  may reach near 12.00 metres around 15-17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- At Wentworth, the Murray River  may exceed the major flood level (33.88 metres AHD) and reach 34.30 metres AHD around the first week of December, with major flooding. \nAlong the Edward River\n- moderate flooding continues at Deniliquin, Stevens Weir and Moulamein. \n- At Moulamein the river is peaking near 5.90 meters from the combined flows along the Edward River and Billabong Creek. Renewed rises are possible from mid to late November onwards.\n- Renewed rises are likely along the Edward River through mid to late November as upstream Murray River flows arrive.\n- At Deniliquin, renewed rises are occurring along the Edward River, where the river level may reach near 9.00 metres around 14-16 November, with moderate flooding.\n- At Stevens Weir Downstream is likely to reach around 6.50 metres around 16-18 November, with moderate flooding.\n\n\nThis message is for communities in Victoria.

Water levels are expected to stay high for a few weeks, due to widespread rain over NSW and Victoria and saturated catchment soils.  \n\n- Major flooding is occurring at Wakool Junction. The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 12.00 metres around 15 to 17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n- Moderate flooding is occurring at Boundary Bend. The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the major flood level (9.00 metres) around Saturday 12 November. The river level may reach near 9.10 metres around 15 to 17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n- The Murray River at Euston may exceed the moderate flood level (9.80 metres, 51.60 metres AHD) around 13-16 November. The river level may exceed the major flood level (10.30 metres, 52.10 metres AHD) around 16 to 18 November and reach around 10.40 metres (52.24 metres AHD) around 19 to 22 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n\nSignificant breakout flows from Torrumbarry have spilled into the Wakool River. These flows, combined with floodwaters from the Murray and Edward Rivers, have caused major flooding at Wakool Junction and may cause major flooding downstream at Boundary Bend, Euston (Robinvale), Mildura and Wentworth, with levels higher than the 1975 flood event. \n\nForecasts will be progressively refined once the upstream flood peaks along the Murray River and its tributaries are observed. \n\nSome properties in rural areas may be isolated due to standing water. Aircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area. Emergency services personnel are assessing impacts on affected properties caused by overtopping and levee breeches.\n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers.  The evaluation of potential impacts on critical infrastructure and townships remains a focus. \n\nThe latest community newsletter dated Wednesday 9 November 2022 is available here: <a href=\"https://files-em.em.vic.gov.au/public/CommNews/Community-Newletters/Community_Newsletter_-_Swan_Hill_Rural_City_Council_-_Wednesday_9_November_2022.pdf?v=202211092001\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Community Newsletter.</a>\n\nUpcoming community drop in sessions for Thursday 10 November:\n\nRobinvale\nOutside Marciano's Cafe\n11.30am to 1pm\n\nWemen\nWemen Store\n2pm to 3.30pm\n\nCommunity drop in sessions provide information to the community on forecast inundation mapping for each area and other important information to ensure the community can be prepared for potential floodwater impacts.\n\nThis message is for communities in Victoria. Flood impacts vary along the Murray River between NSW and Victoria.

Water levels are expected to stay high for a few weeks, due to widespread rain over NSW and Victoria and saturated catchment soils. \n\n- The Murray River at Swan Hill peaked at 4.60 metres around midday Tuesday and is currently at 4.59 metres and falling slowly with near moderate flooding. \n- The Murray River at Swan Hill may remain around the moderate flood level (4.60 m) through to the weekend. \n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 12.00 metres around 15-17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n\nAircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area.\n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers. The evaluation of potential impacts on critical infrastructure and townships remains a focus. \n\nThe latest community newsletter dated Wednesday 9 November 2022 is available here: <a href=\"https://files-em.em.vic.gov.au/public/CommNews/Community-Newletters/Community_Newsletter_-_Swan_Hill_Rural_City_Council_-_Wednesday_9_November_2022.pdf?v=202211092001\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Community Newsletter </a>\n\nUpcoming community drop in session for Piangil:\nPiangil Memorial Park\nThursday 10th November - 8.45am to 10.15am\n\nThe community drop in session is to provide information to the Piangil community on forecast inundation mapping and other important information to ensure the community can be prepared for potential floodwater impacts.\n\nThis message is for communities in Victoria. Flood impacts vary along the Murray River between NSW and Victoria. For information and warnings relevant to NSW, please check <a href=\"www.ses.nsw.gov.au\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">www.ses.nsw.gov.au</a>. Always follow the instructions provided by your State's emergency services.\n\nStay safe - avoid the flooded area. Be aware of potential hazards caused by flooding and never enter floodwater.
