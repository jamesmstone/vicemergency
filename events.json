Renewed rises are likely along the Acheron River at Taggerty during Monday, with forecast rainfall. The river level may reach the minor flood level from Monday evening, with further rises to the moderate flood level possible overnight. \n\nForecast rainfall during Monday and Tuesday is expected to see renewed river level rises throughout the Goulburn River catchment, with prolonged or renewed minor to moderate flooding. \n\nUpdated Community information: \n- Do not put Lithium-ion batteries in with general rubbish. Dispose of via a municipal battery collection facility.  Damaged or defective batteries can overheat, catch fire or explode releasing projectiles and can release toxic gases.\n- Be aware that mosquito borne disease hazards are present so please cover up and use repellent.\n- In flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick. \nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water. Avoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. \nFloodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas. \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  \n\nNever park, take shelter or camp under a tree.   Do not camp close to rivers or creeks.   \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon.    \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

Cover cuts and if you are injured during your clean up; clean the wound and contact your doctor immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;Private water supplies may also be contaminated from floodwater, debris and chemicals. If your water supply tastes, looks or smells unusual, do not use it for drinking, preparing food, and do not give it to animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicines, stored at home and affected by flood water may now be unsafe and extreme caution should be taken in trying to salvage any medicines.&nbsp;Mosquitoes can also breed rapidly in stagnant waters. Drain any water from containers such as plant pots, tyres, buckets, and roof gutters to control mosquitos around your home.&nbsp;Flooding can also cause excessive mould growth which must be cleaned up before moving back to your home as it can make you sick.&nbsp;Any damaged gas or electricity supplies need to be declared safe by a qualified electrician or plumber.&nbsp;Do not&nbsp;use a portable generator indoors, they can produce carbon monoxide gas which could build up in a confined space and make you sick or be fatal.&nbsp;Food safety should also be considered and ALL food that has been flood damaged should be thrown away, including canned and packaged foods.&nbsp;It is important to look after your mental health and that of friends, family and neighbours. If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline 13 11 14 or the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467.This message was issued by&nbsp;State Emergency Service. </li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><b>Accessibility:&nbsp;</b></div><div>The following services can help you, or someone you know, access information during an emergency.&nbsp; </div><div><ul><li>To access this information in other languages call the <a href=\"https://www.tisnational.gov.au/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Translating and Interpreting Service</a> on 131 450 (freecall) and ask them to call VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech/communication impairment contact <a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-technology-communications/phone/services-people-with-disability/accesshub/national-relay-service\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">National Relay Service</a> on 1800 555 677 and ask them to call the VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>","text":"ADVICE - RIVERINE FLOOD - Stay Informed\nIncident Location: Goulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon\nIssue Date: Monday 31 October 2022, 11:56 am\nNext Update: Tuesday 01 November 2022, 12:00 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/25663/moreinfo\n\nThis Minor Flood Warning is being issued for Goulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon.\n\nMinor flooding has eased along the Goulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon at Dohertys, with river levels continuing to fall. Renewed rises and further areas of minor flooding are likely from Monday evening, with forecast rainfall. \nForecast rainfall during Monday and Tuesday is expected to see renewed river level rises throughout the Goulburn River catchment, with prolonged or renewed minor to moderate flooding.\n  \nUpdated Community Information: \n- Do not put Lithium-ion batteries in with general rubbish. Dispose of via a municipal battery collection facility.  Damaged or defective batteries can overheat, catch fire or explode releasing projectiles and can release toxic gases.\n- Be aware that mosquito borne disease hazards are present so please cover up and use repellent.\n- In flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water. \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home. Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas. \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.\n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.   \n\nDo not camp close to rivers or creeks.\n \nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.   \nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.   \nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25663","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25663","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine

Damaged or defective batteries can overheat, catch fire or explode releasing projectiles and can release toxic gases.\n- Be aware that mosquito borne disease hazards are present so please cover up and use repellent.\n- In flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.  \nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water. \nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nPrepare for flooding now. Take actions to protect your life and property against potential hazards caused by flooding. \n\nDo not camp or go bush driving close to rivers or creeks this long weekend!\n\nUnexpected and rapid river and creek levels are very likely even with small amounts of rain and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon dam. Your access tracks in and out might be flooded and you might end up stranded for days.\n\nSupport the local towns and make sure to set a watch zone for your location this long weekend and regularly check emergency radio broadcasters (ABC or UGFM radio) via your car radio if necessary.\n\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25650","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch &

Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25701","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25701","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Broken River downstream of Casey Weir","created":"2022-10-31T14:52:59+11:00","updated":"2022-10-31T14:52:59+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.58596004,-37.62691322]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[145.51990055000002,-37.55648853000001],[145.52420537000003,-37.559999999999995],[145.535,-37.5575],[145.53999999999996,-37.56250000000001],[145.53999999999996,-37.57],[145.54500000000002,-37.57],[145.55003063999996,-37.57834382000001],[145.55499999999998,-37.580000000000005],[145.56047775000002,-37.5925],[145.56393368,-37.59222801],[145.56655711,-37.58653647999999],[145.57247804000002,-37.58681947],[145.5775,-37.57],[145.5875,-37.5675],[145.5875,-37.565],[145.59,-37.5675],[145.5925,-37.565],[145.60120258,-37.567243059999996],[145.60155564999997,-37.57673589],[145.61497969,-37.57107988],[145.6214282,-37.571479139999994],[145.62056305,-37.57522791],[145.62750000000003,-37.580000000000005],[145.63026833,-37.587500000000006],[145.63329495,-37.59000000000002],[145.63740954,-37.58743213],[145.64250000000004,-37.59000000000002],[145.655,-37.60249999999999],[145.655,-37.610004969999984],[145.66059280000002,-37.61757121],[145.6825,-37.625],[145.69427259,-37.6347579],[145.70151606,-37.64677596999999],[145.70192071,-37.65607901],[145.7151324,-37.67694490000001],[145.70058373000003,-37.69857495],[145.68362340000002,-37.697953289999994],[145.6825953,-37.70535681999999],[145.66479949,-37.71104001999999],[145.65026021,-37.70732271],[145.6407459,-37.71032584999999],[145.6266832,-37.70824021000001],[145.60329511,-37.69863026],[145.59320024000002,-37.70077764],[145.57819715999997,-37.69576116999999],[145.57322066,-37.69944163],[145.56756608999999,-37.71382643999999],[145.54862221,-37.70401549999999],[145.5377775,-37.70350726999999],[145.52242858,-37.69434834],[145.50978957,-37.692339350000005],[145.51128826000001,-37.688850650000006],[145.49612709,-37.68497103],[145.49123645,-37.67962290999999],[145.49341823,-37.67327026],[145.49084522999996,-37.66554951999999],[145.48503726,-37.6635407],[145.4830768,-37.65349862],[145.47888745,-37.6494799],[145.48084639,-37.63697487],[145.47314254,-37.60097902],[145.45944531,-37.60256621],[145.45678768000002,-37.58993546000001],[145.46117782,-37.58360821],[145.46451934,-37.54083043999999],[145.4725,-37.540000000000006],[145.47693044,-37.54476013000001],[145.48252292,-37.54490649],[145.48612105,-37.54971102],[145.505,-37.5525],[145.505,-37.55500000000001],[145.51990055000002,-37.55648853000001]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"yohanna.mequwanint@emv.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25627","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25627","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Watts River","created":"2022-10-31T09:37:01+11:00","updated":"2022-10-31T09:37:01+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This&nbsp;<b>Minor Flood Warning </b>is being issued<b>&nbsp;</b>for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"the Watts River\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">the Watts River</span>.<div><br></div><div>The Yarra River catchment has recorded rainfall averaging about 1 mm in the upper part of the catchment and about 1 mm in the lower part of the catchment since 09:00 AM Sunday 30 October 2022.

Renewed rises are likely in coming days as upstream floodwaters arrive and the Goulburn River at Murchison may reach around 9.90 metres during Tuesday, with minor flooding. \n\nThe Goulburn River at Shepparton is currently at 10.34 metres and steady, with minor flooding. Renewed rises are possible in coming days as upstream floodwaters arrive. The Goulburn River at Shepparton may reach the moderate flood level (10.70 m) during Wednesday. \n\nGoulburn Murray Water has advised that releases from Lake Eildon are around 30,000 ML/d and will remain around this flow for the next few days.\n\nForecast rainfall during Monday and Tuesday is expected to see renewed river level rises throughout the Goulburn River catchment, with prolonged or renewed minor to moderate flooding. \n\n\n- Please note that Regional Roads Victoria have advised that the Murchison Bridge on the Murchison-Violet Town Road (High Road) is open to light vehicles only. NO TRUCKS OR HEAVY AGRICULTURE MACHINERY.  \n\n\nUpdated Community Information: \n- Do not put Lithium-ion batteries in with general rubbish. Dispose of via a municipal battery collection facility.

Forecasts will be progressively refined once the upstream flood peaks along the Murray River and its tributaries are observed. \n\n- The Murray River at Swan Hill is likely to exceed the minor flood level (4.50m) during Monday. The river may reach the major flood level (4.70m) during the second week of November (8 to 11 November). \n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach around 11.40m 20 to 23 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the moderate flood level (8.50m) Sunday evening. The river level may reach around 8.70 metres 24 to 26 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Euston may exceed the minor flood level (9.10m) in mid November. The river level may reach around 9.50m 25 to 27 November, with minor flooding.\n- The Murray River at Mildura Weir may exceed the minor flood level (36.00 metres AHD) around 10 to 12 November. The river level may reach 37.50m AHD round the end of November, with moderate flooding, similar to the 1993 flood.\n\nFurther rainfall is forecast during Monday and Tuesday, which may cause renewed river level rises and flooding. The situation is being closely monitored and revised predictions will be provided if necessary. \n\nWater quality update:\nPeople may notice a slight discolouration in their water over the coming weeks due to blackwater within the Murray River. Please be assured that your urban water remains safe to drink and is tested to comply with Australian Drinking Water standards. Blackwater is the discolouration of water in the river, which is caused by high levels of tannins from organic material like fallen leaves and bark and from trees and undergrowth. Lower Murray Water is continuing to monitor and fine tune the treatment processes at our water treatment plants to reduce any clarity and taste impacts associated with treating black water. \n\nCommunity meetings are being held over the coming week for residents in Swan Hill, Robinvale and Mildura.\n- Monday 31 October 6.30pm - Swan Hill Town Hall\n- Wednesday 2 November 6.30pm - Robinvale Community Arts Centre \n- Sunday 6 November 4pm - Mildura Sporting Precinct \n\nAn <a

Newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">updated Community Newsletter</a> is available that has answers to some of your questions from Monday night's community meeting at Swan Hill, information about how to report levee issues and a link to the online interactive map, which shows the estimated 1993 flood extent.\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25589","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25589","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine

Damaged or defective batteries can overheat, catch fire or explode releasing projectiles and can release toxic gases.\n\nBe aware that mosquito borne disease hazards are present so please cover up and use repellent. \n\nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.    \nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  \nContact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas. \n\n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning. If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    \n\nDo not camp close to rivers or creeks.     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.  \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25697","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25697","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Broken Benalla to Casey Weir","created":"2022-10-31T15:32:49+11:00","updated":"2022-10-31T15:32:49+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.91875,-38.040000000000006]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[146.86,-37.932500000000005],[146.86499999999998,-37.945],[146.89249999999998,-37.95],[146.89249999999998,-37.95249999999999],[146.90250000000003,-37.95249999999999],[146.90250000000003,-37.957499999999996],[146.91,-37.95249999999999],[146.91,-37.955],[146.915,-37.955],[146.915,-37.96000000000001],[146.91,-37.9625],[146.91249999999997,-37.9675],[146.92,-37.9675],[146.94,-37.989999999999995],[146.94750000000002,-37.989999999999995],[146.9525,-37.995],[146.9525,-38],[146.9575,-38.0025],[146.9575,-38.00749999999999],[146.9675,-38.00749999999999],[146.9725,-38.0125],[146.975,-38.03249999999999],[146.98,-38.04],[146.99499999999998,-38.02750000000001],[146.99,-38.02],[146.99,-38.0125],[146.98500000000004,-38.010000000000005],[146.98500000000004,-37.9925],[146.9775,-37.98500000000001],[146.99,-37.97249999999999],[146.9875,-37.9675],[146.99,-37.964999999999996],[147.0075,-37.964999999999996],[147.0075,-37.97249999999999],[147.025,-37.989999999999995],[147.025,-37.9975],[147.0375,-37.9975],[147.0375,-38.0025],[147.04249999999996,-38.00749999999999],[147.04249999999996,-38.06],[147.04,-38.06],[147.04,-38.065000000000005],[147.05,-38.065000000000005],[147.05,-38.067499999999995],[147.06499999999997,-38.0725],[147.0675,-38.0875],[147.07500000000002,-38.092499999999994],[147.07500000000002,-38.11],[147.06999999999996,-38.11250000000001],[147.0725,-38.12250000000001],[147.06499999999997,-38.1275],[147.0675,-38.14249999999999],[147.06999999999996,-38.14249999999999],[147.0675,-38.1525],[147.04249999999996,-38.15],[147.0375,-38.145],[147.02750000000003,-38.145],[147.02750000000003,-38.14249999999999],[147.0175,-38.13999999999999],[147.0175,-38.1375],[147.01,-38.1375],[147.01,-38.1325],[146.99999999999997,-38.12499999999999],[146.99999999999997,-38.11749999999999],[147.0075,-38.11],[146.99749999999997,-38.1075],[146.9925,-38.09749999999999],[146.92,-38.09749999999999],[146.91750000000002,-38.092499999999994],[146.91249999999997,-38.092499999999994],[146.895,-38.075],[146.895,-38.065000000000005],[146.9,-38.05749999999999],[146.9,-38.03750000000001],[146.89249999999998,-38.03249999999999],[146.895,-38.02],[146.88750000000002,-38.01499999999999],[146.88750000000002,-38.00749999999999],[146.88,-38],[146.8725,-38.0025],[146.8725,-37.9975],[146.8675,-37.9925],[146.83000000000004,-37.9925],[146.83000000000004,-37.989999999999995],[146.82499999999996,-37.989999999999995],[146.82499999999996,-37.98500000000001],[146.82,-37.98],[146.8125,-37.98],[146.81,-37.975],[146.8,-37.975],[146.79749999999999,-37.97249999999999],[146.79749999999999,-37.975],[146.78249999999997,-37.975],[146.78,-37.9675],[146.7725,-37.9675],[146.77,-37.95249999999999],[146.7625,-37.95],[146.7625,-37.9425],[146.7725,-37.945],[146.775,-37.94],[146.785,-37.9425],[146.78750000000002,-37.9375],[146.79749999999999,-37.94],[146.79749999999999,-37.9375],[146.805,-37.935],[146.805,-37.93],[146.8525,-37.9275],[146.8525,-37.93],[146.86,-37.932500000000005]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"vin.bigham@ses.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25754","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25754","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Thomson River downstream of Wandocka","created":"2022-10-31T17:15:33+11:00","updated":"2022-10-31T17:15:33+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This&nbsp;<b>Minor Flood Warning </b>is being issued<b>&nbsp;</b>for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"Thomson River downstream of Wandocka:\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Thomson River downstream of Wandocka:</span><div><br></div><div>MINOR FLOODING POSSIBLE AT SALE WHARF TUESDAY AFTERNOON </div><div><br></div><div>Recent rainfall has caused river level rises along the Thomson River.
