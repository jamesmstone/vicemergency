Damaging surf conditions are occurring between Blairgowrie and Wilsons Promontory, particularly about exposed west and south-facing coasts.The largest waves are expected to peak during Monday morning.\n- These conditions may produce localised damage and coastal erosion.Beach conditions in these areas will be dangerous and people should stay well away from the surf and surf exposed area. \n- Abnormally High Tides leading to inundation at low lying coasts are possible about Port Phillip Bay, Western Port and other parts of the Central coasts with the Monday afternoon high tides.\nFor the Gippsland coast\n- Abnormally high tides, which may cause sea water flooding of low lying areas, are possible along the Gippsland coasts until late Monday with the evening high tides.\n- Lake levels at Bullock Island (Lakes Entrance) will exceed the minor flood level of 0.9 metres and may reach 1.1 metres on each high tide from Friday morning, 30 August to Monday evening, 2 September.\n-

alert.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"34237","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"34237","category1":"Met","category2":"Storm
