Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday. \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nBemm, Cann and Genoa Rivers \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.       \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.       \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening. Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.       \n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.       \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers.

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.    \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.    \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening. Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.    \n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.    \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.    \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include: \nAvon River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.   \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet. Widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible.    \n\nThe heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening . Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.   \n\nCatchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.\n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:\nUpper Murray and Mitta Mitta Rivers\nKiewa River\nSeven and Castle Creeks\nGoulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon\nGoulburn River Eildon to Seymour\nHughes Creek \n\n\nStay informed

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.\n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening . Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.       \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.        Widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening. Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.      \n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.       \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nMitchell River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.       \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.      \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening. Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.       \n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.       \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nSnowy River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.
