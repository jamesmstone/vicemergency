This includes duck, stubble quail and introduced game bird hunting. \n- Moving game bird carcasses and any equipment associated with game bird hunting into, out of or through the restricted and control areas is prohibited unless under an Agriculture Victoria, issued movement permit.  \n- You can find more information about movement controls and quarantine here: <a href=\"agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianinfluenza\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianinfluenza</a>.\n- To stop the spread of H7 bird flu, birds on infected properties are being destroyed. \n- Agriculture Victoria is ensuring the safe and efficient decontamination and disposal of depopulated birds, and poultry litter and eggs by deep burial and composting in accordance with Environment Protection Authority (EPA) authorisation. \n- Further waste material from the poultry properties, including litter and feed, is now being transported to an Agriculture Victoria property in Rutherglen and managed under stringent biosecurity controls. \n- Strict decontamination and quarantine measures are in place at the Euroa and Rutherglen sites. Security and traffic management plans are also in place to manage safety due to increased traffic movement around the area. \n- Eggs and poultry products from supermarkets are safe to consume.  \n\n\nAll bird owners should regularly check their birds. Unexplained illness or deaths in your birds should be notified to your local vet or by calling the VicEmergency hotline on 1800 226 226.\n\nIf you are located within the warning area and you own birds, you must follow all movement controls.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"37317","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"37317","category1":"Env","category2":"Animal Disease","name":"Community Information","location":"Euroa ","created":"2025-03-19T17:17:52+11:00","updated":"2025-03-19T17:17:53+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.01618819647513,-36.90843754971132]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[145.00254111700696,-36.89882969413107],[145.01970725470352,-36.896495948176884],[145.03017859869595,-36.91653638199716],[145.01163916997973,-36.92037915124576],[145.0021977942543,-36.91914399653354],[145.00254111700696,-36.89882969413107]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Fire","event":"Grass Fire","eventCode":"grassFire","urgency":"Unknown","severity":"Unknown","certainty":"Observed","contact":"s.oconnor@cfa.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Country Fire Authority","responseType":"None"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"37319","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"37319","category1":"Community Update","category2":"Fire","status":"Unknown","name":"Community Information","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Puckapunyal","created":"2025-03-19T18:37:44+11:00","updated":"2025-03-19T18:37:44+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Community Information&nbsp;</b>is being issued for&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_locality\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Puckapunyal</span>.<div><div><ul><li>There is a grassfire at <span title=\"warning_incident_location\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Puckapunyal</span>.</li><li>Smoke may be visible from nearby communities and roads.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%;
