Severe heat      is more dangerous for people over 65 years old, the very young and those      with a pre-existing medical condition.  Continuous high temperatures during the day, and no      relief overnight, can stop the body from cooling down normally. It can      cause heat illness and even heatstroke, which is life-threatening.\n\nBack-to-back days of extreme heat, coupled with high overnight temperatures, can interfere with your body’s natural ability to cool down and can cause heat illness, including cramps and heat exhaustion. If left untreated, this can lead to heatstroke, which is a life-threatening illness.\n\nPrepare now to stay safe in the heat. Be aware of the risk of heat-related health problems and plan ahead to keep yourself and others safe.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"40494","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"40494","category1":"Met","category2":"Extreme
