Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  \nContact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas. \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning. If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    \n\nIf you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.  \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

Catchments with recent or existing warnings where river levels are elevated may see fast response to further rainfall and moderate flooding is possible from early next week at some locations.\n\nMinor Flood Warnings are already in place for the Ovens River from Bright to downstream of Rocky Point, and the Buffalo River.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25415","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25415","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"the Ovens and King River Catchment","created":"2022-10-29T14:08:16+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T14:08:16+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.61100656264483,-36.04361883023621]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[144.6046550916979,-36.04273404425975],[144.60615712874306,-36.04269934383278],[144.60830289596075,-36.04200533208619],[144.60963327162963,-36.041276613169266],[144.6101053404168,-36.04030497745645],[144.61319524519982,-36.0419706313388],[144.6130235838235,-36.0427687446707],[144.61688596480454,-36.04485074137152],[144.61735803359176,-36.04537123194414],[144.60482675307424,-36.046932683015974],[144.6046550916979,-36.04273404425975]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Immediate","severity":"Moderate","certainty":"Likely","contact":"eloise.seymour@parks.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Execute"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25363","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch & Act","id":"25363","category1":"Watch and Act","category2":"Met","status":"Moderate","name":"Watch & Act","action":"Move to Higher Ground","statewide":"N","location":"Wharparilla","created":"2022-10-29T11:17:20+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T11:17:20+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Major Flood Warning</b> is being issued\nfor <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"Wharparilla area.\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Wharparilla area.</span>.&nbsp;<div><br><div>Flooding has impacted residents in the area of Glyn Road, Wharparilla.&nbsp;<br><br>Flooding is expected to remain at current levels for the next week.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The latest community newsletter from Saturday 29 October is available here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://files-em.em.vic.gov.au/public/CommNews/Community-Newletters/Community_Newsletter_29_October_2022_Final_.pdf?v=202210291105\" title=\"Community newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Community newsletter</a></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\"><b>Move to higher ground.

Moderate flooding is continuing at Kialla West.\n\nFurther rainfall is forecast for the Seven and Castle Creek catchments from Sunday evening which may result in renewed river level rises into next week. The situation is being closely monitored, and warnings will be updated as necessary. \n\n\nSeven Creeks downstream of Euroa\n- Moderate flooding is occurring along the Seven Creeks downstream of Euroa.\n- The Seven Creeks at Kialla West is currently at 5.21 metres and steady, with moderate flooding. The Seven Creeks at Kialla West may remain above the moderate flood level (5.00 m) for the remainder of Saturday and into Sunday.\n\n\nUpdated Community information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.   \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    \n\nIf you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.  \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

Minor flooding is currently occurring along the Goulburn River catchment at Taggerty, Seymour, Murchison, Shepparton and McCoys Bridge.\nGoulburn Murray Water has advised that releases from Lake Eildon will be increasing to around 30,000 ML/d from Saturday evening (around 06:00 pm).The situation is being closely monitored, and warnings will be updated as necessary.\nAcheron River:\nMinor flooding is occurring along the Acheron River.\nThe Acheron River at Taggerty peaked around the moderate flood level (2.60 m) overnight Friday into Saturday and is currently at 2.45 metres and falling, with minor flooding. The Acheron River at Taggerty is likely to remain above the minor flood level (2.30 m) during Saturday and into Sunday. \nUpdated Community information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.    \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  \n\nNever park, take shelter or camp under a tree.     If you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon.    \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    \n\nIf you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon.    \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25431","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25431","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Lake Corangamite","created":"2022-10-29T15:04:52+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T15:04:53+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.68124999999998,-38.101657765000006]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[145.54898816999997,-37.96721550000001],[145.56092339999998,-37.98572431],[145.56940333,-37.98717314],[145.57894125,-37.99779332000001],[145.58226175,-37.99391305999999],[145.60388191,-38.00645802],[145.60908748000003,-38.0138488],[145.60499223,-38.01791046999999],[145.61335068,-38.02527852],[145.61462191,-38.03165458],[145.63463656,-38.04831772],[145.63403390999997,-38.06050727],[145.64056071,-38.06963253],[145.65545763,-38.07336347],[145.66337846,-38.07766592000001],[145.66671057,-38.08442516],[145.67862904,-38.08754556],[145.67999245,-38.09419271],[145.66762612,-38.09087003],[145.66185442,-38.09508256],[145.65358869,-38.0949938],[145.6536116,-38.10016691],[145.67282119000004,-38.10634952],[145.66739058000002,-38.11213720000001],[145.66206945999997,-38.11270663999999],[145.65821448,-38.13363038999999],[145.66635417000003,-38.13736839],[145.66475530000002,-38.1494324],[145.70751219,-38.15462036],[145.70567525000004,-38.16392435000001],[145.72223769999997,-38.16591509999999],[145.77930816,-38.12958096],[145.79940207000004,-38.12559577999999],[145.81071001,-38.12805389],[145.83995783,-38.12604879999999],[145.86331884,-38.13958536999999],[145.88339938,-38.141567290000005],[145.88750000000002,-38.145],[145.885,-38.15],[145.89,-38.15749999999999],[145.89,-38.177499999999995],[145.88247009,-38.18005313],[145.8775,-38.1875],[145.87230205,-38.18920770000001],[145.87297394,-38.19259997999998],[145.8677815,-38.19616219],[145.85749999999996,-38.197500000000005],[145.8525,-38.1925],[145.84500000000003,-38.1925],[145.84500000000003,-38.205],[145.83043323000004,-38.21021051000001],[145.8075,-38.21500000000001],[145.76749999999998,-38.21500000000001],[145.765,-38.22249999999998],[145.75983385,-38.22493945],[145.745,-38.227500000000006],[145.73186357,-38.23610003],[145.71549006,-38.23332323000001],[145.70849982,-38.225456380000004],[145.69218338999997,-38.22750093999999],[145.68557441999997,-38.230847829999995],[145.67250000000004,-38.227500000000006],[145.65986915,-38.22269637000001],[145.63999999999996,-38.227500000000006],[145.61963791,-38.230000620000006],[145.59999999999997,-38.227500000000006],[145.59,-38.224999999999994],[145.5475,-38.227500000000006],[145.52,-38.23250000000001],[145.48679575,-38.23405433],[145.48250001,-38.228791369999996],[145.48,-38.21999999999999],[145.4725,-38.217499999999994],[145.4725,-38.205],[145.495,-38.1825],[145.51,-38.1725],[145.5225,-38.15749999999999],[145.535,-38.145],[145.54500000000002,-38.1375],[145.55499999999998,-38.12499999999999],[145.5675,-38.105],[145.57000002,-38.09099175],[145.565,-38.07999999999999],[145.5575,-38.067499999999995],[145.5525,-38.06],[145.55246087000003,-38.04240574000001],[145.5425,-38.04],[145.535,-38.03249999999999],[145.530224,-38.02468190999999],[145.5225,-38.0225],[145.52,-38.02],[145.51595407,-38.01196511999999],[145.5,-38.00500000000001],[145.495,-37.9975],[145.495,-37.9875],[145.4969388,-37.9746274],[145.52127182,-37.97506327],[145.53234654,-37.978449259999984],[145.54613926999997,-37.97534844999999],[145.54898816999997,-37.96721550000001]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"jackson.evans@ses.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25437","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25437","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Bunyip River downstream of Iona","created":"2022-10-29T15:19:22+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T15:19:23+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This&nbsp;<b>Minor Flood Warning </b>is being issued<b>&nbsp;</b>for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"Bunyip River downstream of Iona\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Bunyip River downstream of Iona</span>.<div><br></div><div>The Bunyip River catchment has recorded rainfall averaging about 28 mm since 09:00 AM Friday 28 October 2022.

People and boats are prohibited from entering the river between these locations. Any person on the Murray between these points are to leave the river. This declaration applies to all residents on both sides of the border. Neither NSW or Victorian users are permitted on the river at this time.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Blackwater and blue green algae:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Significant\nrainfall and flooding can cause water quality issues like low-oxygen (hypoxic)\nblackwater and blue green algae. High levels of organic matter have been washed\ninto waterways and, combined with warm weather, can cause oxygen levels in the\nwater to drop. This can harm or cause the death of fish and crayfish. River\nmanagers and scientists monitor rivers for water quality issues and work to\nreduce the impacts of a blackwater event where they can. Low levels of\ndissolved oxygen are recorded at several locations across northern Victoria and\nin the Murray River. The scale of the current flooding means water quality will\nnot improve quickly. Any fish death event in Victoria should be reported to the\nEPA by calling 1300 372 842. </div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><div>This message was issued\nby <span title=\"warning_issuing_agency\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">State Emergency Service</span>.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The\nnext update is expected by <span title=\"warning_next_update\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">30/10/2022 05:30 pm</span>&nbsp;or as the situation changes.</b></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Use multiple sources to stay informed:</b></div></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">www.emergency.vic.gov.au</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001055007-What-is-the-VicEmergency-Hotline-\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency Hotline</a>&nbsp;- freecall 1800 226 226</li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/230492607-What-is-the-VicEmergency-app-a\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency app</a></li><li><a href=\"https://facebook.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> (#vicfloods)</li><li>Tune in to ABC Local Radio, commercial and designated community radio stations, or Sky News TV.</li></ul><div><b>Accessibility:&nbsp;</b></div></div><div>The following services can help you, or someone you know, access information during an emergency.&nbsp; </div><div><ul><li>To access this information in other languages call the <a href=\"https://www.tisnational.gov.au/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Translating and Interpreting Service</a> on 131 450 (freecall) and ask them to call VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech/communication impairment contact <a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-technology-communications/phone/services-people-with-disability/accesshub/national-relay-service\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">National Relay Service</a> on 1800 555 677 and ask them to call the VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>","text":"ADVICE - RIVERINE FLOOD - Stay Informed\nIncident Location: Murray River downstream of Barham to Wentworth\nIssue Date: Saturday 29 October 2022, 08:30 pm\nNext Update: Sunday 30 October 2022, 05:30 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/25461/moreinfo\n\n\nThis Minor Flood Warning is being issued for Murray River downstream of Barham to Wentworth.\n\nFloodwaters from the Campaspe and Goulburn Rivers combined with flows down the Murray River have caused major flooding at Echuca where the river level peaked around 94.98m AHD Wednesday night, higher than the October 1993 and November 1975 flood peaks.\n\nAs this flood peak extends downstream, major flooding is possible on the Murray River at Swan Hill and moderate flooding may occur at Mildura. Minor flooding is occurring at Boundary Bend, with moderate flooding possible.\n\n- The Murray River at Swan Hill is likely to exceed the minor flood level (4.50m) late Saturday into Sunday. The river may reach the major flood level (4.70m) during the second week of November (8 to 11 November).\n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach around 11.40m around 20 to 23 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the moderate flood level (8.50m) late Saturday into Sunday. The river level may reach around 8.70m around 24 to 26 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Euston may exceed the minor flood level (9.10m) in mid-November. The river level may reach around 9.50m between 25 and 27 November, with minor flooding.\n- The Murray River at Mildura Weir may exceed the minor flood level (36.00mAHD) around 10 to 12 November. The river level may reach 37.50m AHD round the end of November, with moderate flooding, similar to the 1993 flood.\n\nCommunity updates\nCould you spare an hour or two to help fill pallets of sandbags from 9.30am tomorrow (Sunday) at the Lake Boga Community Centre?\n- These filled sandbags are being laid by the thousand each day with the support of our friends from the ADF, and we need to keep up the supply to them so they can continue their great work. \n- Please bring a shovel if you can, high visibility clothing (vest or shirt) and wear secure footwear (steel cap boots preferred).\n- There will be a BBQ after the community meeting to say 'thank you' to all who turned out to help.\n\nCommunity meetings are being held tomorrow (Sunday) for residents of Lake Boga, Nyah, Tyntynder, Beverford and surrounding local areas:\n- 12pm - Lake Boga Community Centre\n- 2pm - Community Centre, Nyah Recreation Reserve\n- 3.30pm - Beverford School.\n\nAn <a

Cover cuts and if you are injured during your clean up; clean the wound and contact your doctor immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;Private water supplies may also be contaminated from floodwater, debris and chemicals. If your water supply tastes, looks or smells unusual, do not use it for drinking, preparing food, and do not give it to animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicines, stored at home and affected by flood water may now be unsafe and extreme caution should be taken in trying to salvage any medicines.&nbsp;Mosquitoes can also breed rapidly in stagnant waters. Drain any water from containers such as plant pots, tyres, buckets, and roof gutters to control mosquitos around your home.&nbsp;Flooding can also cause excessive mould growth which must be cleaned up before moving back to your home as it can make you sick.&nbsp;Any damaged gas or electricity supplies need to be declared safe by a qualified electrician or plumber.&nbsp;Do not&nbsp;use a portable generator indoors, they can produce carbon monoxide gas which could build up in a confined space and make you sick or be fatal.&nbsp;Food safety should also be considered and ALL food that has been flood damaged should be thrown away, including canned and packaged foods.&nbsp;It is important to look after your mental health and that of friends, family and neighbours. If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline 13 11 14 or the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467.This message was issued by&nbsp;State Emergency Service. </li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><b>Accessibility:&nbsp;</b></div><div>The following services can help you, or someone you know, access information during an emergency.&nbsp; </div><div><ul><li>To access this information in other languages call the <a href=\"https://www.tisnational.gov.au/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Translating and Interpreting Service</a> on 131 450 (freecall) and ask them to call VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech/communication impairment contact <a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-technology-communications/phone/services-people-with-disability/accesshub/national-relay-service\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">National Relay Service</a> on 1800 555 677 and ask them to call the VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>","text":"ADVICE - RIVERINE FLOOD - Stay Informed\nIncident Location: Goulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon\nIssue Date: Saturday 29 October 2022, 06:45 pm\nNext Update: Sunday 30 October 2022, 12:50 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/25468/moreinfo\n\nThis Minor Flood Warning is being issued for Goulburn River upstream of Lake Eildon.\n\nUpdated Community Information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   To prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.   Avoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas. The wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    If you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!    Unexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.  \n Stay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.   In the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.\n- MODERATE FLOODING OCCURRING DOWNSTREAM OF LAKE EILDON SINCE SATURDAY MORNING\n- MODERATE FLOODING POSSIBLE AT SEYMOUR SUNDAY MORNINGMINOR FLOODING OCCURRING AT TAGGERTY, SEYMOUR, MURCHISON, SHEPPARTON AND MCCOYS BRIDGE\n- Moderate flooding developed Downstream of Lake Eildon during Saturday morning and may develop along the Goulburn River at Seymour during Sunday morning.
