West-northwesterly winds will likely restrengthen a little across elevated areas today as the post-frontal air stream strengthens.\n\nFor the north east ranges: Damaging winds have temporarily eased over much of the area, but stronger winds averaging 60 to 70 km/h with peak gusts of around 100 km/h are expected to redevelop over the highest terrain during this morning and persist into the afternoon.\n\nDestructive wind gusts exceeding 125 km/h are no longer expected.\n\nRainfall rates have eased in the past few hours, and no further heavy rainfall heavy enough to produce flash flooding is expected over the area. \n\nDamaging winds are expected to ease throughout by late this afternoon.\n\nLocations which may be affected include Dargo, Mt Baw Baw, Falls Creek, Mt Hotham and Omeo.\n\nSevere weather is no longer occurring in the Central, South West, Northern Country and North Central districts and the warning for these districts is cancelled.\n\nA 124 km/h wind gust was recorded at Falls Creek at 2 am and 79 mm of rain was recorded in the 6 hours to 4 am at Mount Hotham. \n\nStay informed and be aware of potential hazards caused by the severe weather. Hazards include fallen trees, powerlines and damage to properties.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"33651","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"33651","category1":"Met","category2":"Severe Weather","name":"Advice","location":"North East Ranges","created":"2024-05-31T07:25:09+10:00","updated":"2024-05-31T07:25:10+10:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[142.85645534484502,-37.723624513505364]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[142.86323596923728,-37.69884556546071],[142.86478092162432,-37.69667233942863],[142.87061740844672,-37.69775896040806],[142.8793721386668,-37.70522904850664],[142.8767972180128,-37.71310578043599],[142.88108875243915,-37.72600551535381],[142.8793721386668,-37.738903003872196],[142.8695874401797,-37.74677615549969],[142.8541379162555,-37.7505766875821],[142.8318219372509,-37.741210738520145],[142.83594181030097,-37.72369730675621],[142.84315158813405,-37.72016696623432],[142.85379459350284,-37.72016696623432],[142.86272098509932,-37.71527852466856],[142.85636951415685,-37.71079716987869],[142.86117603271225,-37.70590811009666],[142.8603177258216,-37.700475443178306],[142.86323596923728,-37.69884556546071]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Env","event":"Blue Green Algae","eventCode":"blueGrnAlgae","urgency":"Unknown","severity":"Unknown","certainty":"Observed","contact":"christine.millington@delwp.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Other Agencies","responseType":"None"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"33635","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"33635","category1":"Community Update","category2":"Env","status":"Unknown","name":"Community Information","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Lake Bolac","created":"2024-05-24T10:48:38+10:00","updated":"2024-05-24T10:48:38+10:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>message</b> is being issued for water quality at Lake Bolac<div><br><ul><li>&nbsp;High levels of blue-green algae have been detected in the lake.</li><li>&nbsp;The algal bloom is expected to remain until there is significant rainfall to flush the lake or cooler conditions slow the\nalgae.</li><li>&nbsp;Regular testing is being conducted to identify new outbreaks or changes that might indicate improved water quality.&nbsp;</li><li>This notification will be reviewed weekly and updated as the situation changes.&nbsp;<br></li></ul></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Warning signs have been installed at the lake.&nbsp;<div><br><div>You should avoid direct contact with the affected water in Lake Bolac.</div><div><br></div><div>Do not swim in affected areas or use water for cooking, drinking, washing, or showering.
