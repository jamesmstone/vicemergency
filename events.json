buried. \n- This could still result in an increase in shark activity in the area.\n- A whale carcass can attract sharks to the area and mean they are closer to the shore than normal.\n- You should not swim in the water at Sandy Point beach, however, the beach itself has now reopened.\n- This Advice replaces the Advice warning issued on Monday 29 September 2025 at 3:28 pm. \n\n\nDo not enter the
