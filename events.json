Floodwaters may contain sewage and other\ncontaminants.\n\n&nbsp;Stay out of the water - skin contact with\nfloodwater or mud can cause illness and skin infections. Cover cuts and if you\nare injured during your clean up; clean the wound and contact your doctor\nimmediately.&nbsp; \n\nPeople’s private\nwater supplies may also be contaminated from floodwater, debris and chemicals.\nIf your water supply tastes, looks or smells unusual, do not use it for\ndrinking, preparing food, and do not give it to animals.&nbsp; \n\nMedicines, stored at\nhome and affected by flood water may now be unsafe and extreme caution should\nbe taken in trying to salvage any medicines. \n\nMosquitoes can also\nbreed rapidly in stagnant waters. Drain any water from containers such as plant\npots, tyres, buckets, and roof gutters to control mosquitos around your home. \n\n&nbsp; Flooding can also cause excessive mould\ngrowth which must be cleaned up before moving back to your home as it can make\nyou sick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; Flooding can cause sewage to overflow inside\nyour home. Contact with sewage can make people sick, so contaminated areas must\nbe cleaned and disinfected.\n\n&nbsp;Any damaged gas or electricity supplies need\nto be declared safe by a qualified electrician or plumber. Do not use a\nportable generator indoors, they can produce carbon monoxide gas which could\nbuild up in a confined space and make you sick or be fatal.\n\nFood safety should\nalso be considered and ALL food that has been flood damaged should be thrown\naway including canned and packaged foods. \n\n&nbsp; It is important to look after your mental\nhealth and that of friends, family and neighbours.

warnings are current for the Seven Creeks, Goulburn and the Broken Creek.    \n\nMinor flood warnings are current for the Ovens and King, Kiewa and Upper Murray Rivers. \n\nCatchments likely to be

Catchments in the Flood Watch area are saturated, many of which are experiencing ongoing flooding.\n\nRenewed river rises are not expected to increase the currently forecast major flood peaks along the Murray River.\n\nIn locations where thunderstorms develop, particularly in the catchment, localised flooding is possible due to heavy rainfall. \n\nThis Advice replaces the Flood Watch issued at 4.21 PM 24/10/2022.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\nNever Enter Floodwater.\n\nBe aware of the increased likelihood of trees falling due to the very wet ground, especially in windy conditions. Never shelter under trees.

Tuesday 25 October 2022, 03:13 pm\nNext Update: Wednesday 26 October 2022, 03:00 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/24901/moreinfo\n\nThis Flood Watch is being issued for the Broken River to Benalla\n\nRENEWED RIVER RISES AND MINOR TO MODERATE FLOODING ARE POSSIBLE FROM TUESDAY\n\nShowers and thunderstorms may occur across most of the state during Tuesday, more likely on and north of the divide, contracting to central and eastern districts during Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nA low pressure system and trough will cross Victoria over the next few days bringing widespread rainfall over the flood watch area.  \n\nCatchments in the Flood Watch area are saturated, many of which are experiencing ongoing flooding.\n\nRenewed river rises are not expected to increase the currently forecast major flood peaks along the Murray River.\n\nIn locations where thunderstorms develop, particularly in the catchment, localised flooding is possible  due to heavy rainfall.\n\n\nThis Advice replaces the Advice  issued at 10.57 AM 2510/2022\n\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions, remain alert and never enter floodwater.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"24901","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"24901","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine
