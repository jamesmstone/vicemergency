The low is expected to move into the Tasman sea on Thursday and remain slow moving before finally moving away from Victoria during the weekend. This will bring widespread rain and showers over the State with possible heavy falls in the east and south Gippsland during Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nCatchments are relatively dry. Widespread rainfall totals of 50-100 mm are forecast across the flood watch area for the remainder of Wednesday. Further rainfall totals of 50-100 mm are forecast in the east on Thursday with isolated higher totals possible in the Gippsland area.\n\nRiver level rises are expected and minor to moderate flooding is likely for the catchments listed from Wednesday. Potential for major flooding in Gippsland with higher possible rainfall totals.\n\nFlooding is possible in the upper reaches of the Maribyrnong and Werribee River catchments with higher possible
