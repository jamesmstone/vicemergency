This will bring widespread rainfall in the Flood Watch area and is likely to cause minor flooding, with isolated moderate flooding from Monday morning.\n\nCatchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 30 to 60 mm are likely in the western catchments of Flood Watch area on Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals of 60-80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 60 to 100 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area from late Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nShowers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and

Widespread rainfall totals of 60 to 100 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area from late Sunday into Monday.    \n\nIsolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.  Showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.    \nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31932","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"31932","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Kiewa River","created":"2024-01-05T15:40:33+11:00","updated":"2024-01-05T15:40:34+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"properties":{"status":"In Progress","feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"VIC/DELWP","sourceId":3021766,"sourceFeed":"delwp-burns","sourceTitle":"Buchan - Buchan Caves Reserve Heap","id":3021766,"category1":"Planned Burn","category2":"Planned Burn","created":"2024-01-02T23:59:45.000Z","updated":"2024-01-02T23:59:45.000Z","resources":0,"size":"0.07","sizeFmt":"0.07 Ha.","url":"https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/bushfire-fuel-and-risk-management/planned-burning-in-victoria","location":"1Km W Of Buchan"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[148.1598139,-37.5023039]}},{"properties":{"status":"Request For Assistance","estaId":113472472,"feedType":"incident","source":"000","sourceOrg":"VIC/SES","sourceId":507878,"sourceFeed":"ses-incident","sourceTitle":"Undefined","eventId":240101955,"id":"ESTA:240101955","suppress":false,"category1":"Rescue","category2":"Rescue Road Trap","created":"2024-01-05T05:15:00.000Z","updated":"2024-01-05T05:16:00.000Z","resources":0,"location":"Coldstream","cfaId":1975560,"size":"Small","sizeFmt":"Small","sesId":507878},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.38525154065252,-37.71933074480132]}},{"properties":{"status":"Responding","estaId":113472527,"feedType":"incident","source":"000","sourceOrg":"VIC/ESTA","sourceId":113472527,"sourceFeed":"esta-cad-event","sourceTitle":"Landsborough","eventId":"F240101958","id":"ESTA:240101958","suppress":false,"category1":"Fire","category2":"Building Fire","created":"2024-01-05T05:18:43.000Z","updated":"2024-01-05T05:19:21.052Z","resources":0,"location":"Hudswell Rd, Landsborough"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[143.12234813431013,-37.01050691486404]}},{"properties":{"status":"Under Control","feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"NSW/RFS","sourceId":"530723","sourceFeed":"rfs-cap","sourceTitle":"Forest Dr, Thurgoona","id":"2024-01-05T00:11:00.0000000:530723","category1":"Fire","category2":"Bushfire","name":"Forest Dr, Thurgoona","location":"Forest Dr, Thurgoona 2640","created":"2024-01-05T00:11:00+11:00","updated":"2024-01-05T00:11:00+11:00","webHeadline":"A fire has started There is no immediate danger.
