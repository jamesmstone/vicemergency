The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon and rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments during Tuesday and into Wednesday.       \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.       \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.       \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria.       \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast through to the Upper Murrumbidgee.       \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nLatrobe River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

Tuesday 26 December 2023, 02:00 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/31625/moreinfo\n\nThis Minor Flood Warning is being issued for Otway Coast.\nISOLATED MINOR FLOODING POSSIBLE WITH LOCALISED FLOODING LIKELY ACROSS PARTS OF THE FLOOD WATCH AREA DURING MONDAY INTO TUESDAY   \n\n-  A low-pressure system is lingering over the state during Monday and is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday and Wednesday. \n- This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.   \n- In the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm have been observed in central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100 mm.    \n-  Catchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into Monday.    \n-  Further widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. \n- The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon.\n-  Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.    \n-  In areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop and catchments may respond quickly.\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop and catchments may respond quickly.\n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.\n- In the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50mm have been observed in central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100mm.\n- Catchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into Monday.\n- Further widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon. \n- Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area. \n- In areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop and catchments may respond quickly.\n\n\n\nStay informed

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.       \n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm have been observed in  central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100 mm.       \n\nCatchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into  Monday.       \n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon and rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments during Tuesday and into Wednesday.       \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.       \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.       \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria.       \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast through to the Upper Murrumbidgee.       \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nTraralgon Creek \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.      \n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm have been observed in  central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100 mm.       \n\nCatchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into  Monday.       \n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon and rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments during Tuesday and into Wednesday.       \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.       \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.       \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria.       \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast through to the Upper Murrumbidgee.      \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nMitchell River \n\n\nStay informed -

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.       \n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm have been observed in  central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100 mm.       \n\nCatchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into  Monday.       \n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon and rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments during Tuesday and into Wednesday.       \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.       \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.       \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria.       \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast through to the Upper Murrumbidgee.    \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.      \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include: \n\nMacalister River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This system is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and may cause isolated minor flooding with localised flooding likely from Monday.       \n\nIn the 24 hours to 10:00 am Monday, widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm have been observed in  central and western parts of the State with localised higher totals of up to 100 mm.       \n\nCatchments across the flood watch area are moderately wet following rainfall during Sunday and into  Monday.       \n\nFurther widespread rainfall totals of 10 to 50 mm are expected in the watch area during Monday and into Tuesday morning, with isolated heavier falls of up to 80 mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms from late Monday afternoon and rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments during Tuesday and into Wednesday.       \n\nIsolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon.       \n\nIn areas where the heaviest rainfall occurs with thunderstorms, localised flooding is likely to develop, and catchments may respond quickly.       \n\nA Severe Weather Warning for heavy rainfall is current for parts of Victoria.       \n\nA Flood Watch is current in NSW for rivers in the South Coast through to the Upper Murrumbidgee.         \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers.
