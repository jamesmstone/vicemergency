In the 24 hours to 9:00 am Monday, rainfall totals up to 181 mm were observed across parts of the Flood Watch area.\n\nCatchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 25 to 60 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area for the remainder of Monday. \n\nHigher isolated totals are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nRainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate to major flooding is likely to continue during the remainder of Monday and into Tuesday for parts of the Flood Watch catchments.\n\nFlooding may continue to develop in catchments throughout the Flood

The system is forecast to move out over the Tasman Sea early Tuesday.\n- In the 24 hours to 9:00 am Monday, rainfall totals up to 181 mm were observed across parts of the Flood Watch area.\n- Catchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n- Widespread rainfall totals of 25 to 60 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area for the remainder of Monday.\n- Higher isolated totals are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n- Rainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n- River level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate to major flooding is likely to continue during the remainder of Monday and into Tuesday for parts of the Northern Flood Watch catchments.\n- River level rises and widespread minor flooding is likely to occur for parts of the Gippsland and Central Flood Watch catchments.\n- Flooding may continue to develop in catchments throughout the Flood Watch area. \n\n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"32135","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"32135","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Snowy River","created":"2024-01-08T16:35:33+11:00","updated":"2024-01-08T16:35:33+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[145.40983751635008,-37.21236791927248]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[145.4055674395991,-37.209941298741626],[145.40561035494096,-37.21479453980333],[145.41410759310105,-37.21411100361252],[145.4055674395991,-37.209941298741626]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Immediate","severity":"Extreme","certainty":"Likely","contact":"m.crosier@cfa.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Execute"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"32123","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Emergency Warning","id":"32123","category1":"Emergency Warning","category2":"Met","status":"Extreme","name":"Emergency Warning","action":"Too Late to Leave","statewide":"N","location":"Yea - West - Mulqueeny Lane, Clarence Way, Newberry Chase and Buckland Court","created":"2024-01-08T15:45:50+11:00","updated":"2024-01-08T15:45:50+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Emergency Warning</b> is for <span title=\"warning_locality\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Yea - West - Mulqueeny Lane, Clarence Way, Newberry Chase and Buckland Court</span>.<div><div><ul><li>An <b>Evacuation\nWarning</b> remains current, but it is now too late to leave.&nbsp;</li><li>The flood is currently impacting this area.</li></ul></div></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">It is now too late to leave for people in Mulqueeny Lane, Clarence Way, Newberry Chase and Buckland Court &nbsp; .

Catchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n- Widespread rainfall totals of 25 to 60 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area for the

Widespread rainfall across the Flood Watch area has caused minor flooding, with isolated moderate and major flooding. The system is forecast to move out over the Tasman Sea early Tuesday.\n\nIn the 24 hours to 9:00 am Monday, rainfall totals up to 181 mm were observed across parts of the Flood Watch area.\n\nCatchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 25 to 60 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area for the remainder of Monday.\n\nHigher isolated totals are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nRainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday. \n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate to major flooding is likely to continue during the remainder of Monday and into Tuesday for parts of the
