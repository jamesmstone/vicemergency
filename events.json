A further 5-15mm fell in the 6 hours from 9am Thursday.\n\nA minor flood peak was observed along the Buckland River at Harris Lane Thursday morning and these floodwaters caused a peak just below the minor flood level along the Ovens River at Eurobin around midday Thursday. River levels upstream of Eurobin on the Ovens River at Bright are yet to peak, and a second minor flood peak at Eurobin is possible due to these floodwaters overnight Thursday into Friday.\n\nMinor flooding is occurring along the Buffalo River downstream of Lake Buffalo and is likely to continue into Friday.\n\nA minor flood peak was observed along the King River D/S Lake William Hovell and a major flood peak was observed at Cheshunt both around midday. The King River at Docker Rd Bridge may peak near the major flood level overnight Thursday into Friday.\n\nA moderate flood peak was observed along Fifteen Mile Creek at Greta South around midday, with river levels likely to remain above the minor flood level overnight Thursday into Friday. \n\nOvens River to Bright:\nMinor flooding may occur along the Ovens River to Bright.\n\nThe Ovens River at Bright is currently at 2.41 metres and rising, below the minor flood level. The Ovens River at Bright may reach the minor flood level (3.00 m) overnight Thursday into Friday. \n\nBuckland River:\nMinor flooding is no longer occurring along the Buckland River at Harris Lane. \n\nOvens River Bright to Rocky Point:\nMinor flooding is likely along the Ovens River Bright to Rocky Point.\n\nThe Ovens River at Eurobin peaked at 4.37 metres around midday Thursday, just below the minor flood level, and is currently at 4.11 metres and falling. Renewed river level rises to the minor flood level (4.50 metres) are possible along the Ovens River at Eurobin Thursday into Friday.\n\nThe Ovens River at Rocky Point is currently at 3.08 metres and rising, below the minor flood level.
