These conditions may produce localised damage and coastal erosion. Beach conditions in these areas will be dangerous and people should stay well away from the surf and surf exposed area. In particular, exposed west and south-facing coasts between Nelson and Cape Otway and between St Andrews Beach and Wilsons Promontory are most at risk of damaging surf conditions.\n\nLocations which may be affected by abnormally high tides include Lakes Entrance, Metung, Paynesville. Locations which may be affected by damaging surf include Warrnambool, Portland, Nelson, and southern parts of Mornington Peninsula and Phillip Island. \n\nAvoid the area and stay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.\nStay well away from the surf and surf-exposed areas. Never enter floodwater.
