Catchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.    \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 30 to 60 mm are likely in the western and central and Gippsland catchments of Flood Watch area on Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals of 60 to 80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.    \n\nIsolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms. Rainfall will ease and showers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.    \n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments.     \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"32006","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"32006","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Thomson River","created":"2024-01-07T15:09:17+11:00","updated":"2024-01-07T15:09:19+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[148.7935873779125,-37.79348980290882]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[148.85212390744985,-37.78412928750077],[148.85203807675722,-37.789725390341296],[148.8162037643189,-37.79067498997756],[148.7935873779125,-37.79348980290882],[148.77633540952328,-37.79627059712533],[148.75959842527206,-37.79918692738697],[148.75174491727546,-37.80237441248694],[148.74826877438898,-37.81041033344842],[148.7367674621385,-37.812003851001606],[148.7302443298107,-37.81573322573188],[148.72861354673103,-37.814546626934394],[148.73140304410325,-37.80996956720205],[148.73483627164794,-37.8070875692115],[148.74230354154105,-37.806477249322946],[148.74384849393707,-37.8048836125],[148.74127357328302,-37.80345948241338],[148.7423893722337,-37.80003467621211],[148.74732463682358,-37.79711837942002],[148.75882594907407,-37.79443935416576],[148.76341789091126,-37.79298110971546],[148.7745329650673,-37.79094630191756],[148.80543201291562,-37.7861642830194],[148.82431476438455,-37.78473979204045],[148.85212390744985,-37.78412928750077]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Env","event":"Dangerous Animal","eventCode":"animalDanger","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"doster.mitchell@delwp.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Other Agencies","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31846","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"31846","category1":"Advice","category2":"Env","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Avoid the Area","statewide":"N","location":"Cape Conran","created":"2024-01-02T10:10:01+11:00","updated":"2024-01-02T10:10:01+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Advice </b>message is being issued for&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_locality\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Cape Conran</span>.<div><br></div><div><ul><li>&nbsp;Due to a <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[whale carcass / whale stranding]\" data-value=\"0\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;whale carcass&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;whale stranding&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">whale carcass</span>&nbsp;there <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[has been/could be]\" data-value=\"1\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;has been&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;could be&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">could be</span>&nbsp;an increase in shark activity.</li><li>A&nbsp;<span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[whale carcass / whale stranding]\" data-value=\"0\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;whale carcass&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;whale stranding&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">whale carcass</span>&nbsp;can attract sharks\nto the area and mean they are closer to the shore than normal.</li><li>While it is not uncommon for sharks to be\npresent off the Victorian coast, you should exercise additional caution in the\narea. </li></ul></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Avoid the area.
