Bird      owners who reside in the control area no longer need to house all their      poultry in cages or sheds.  \n- No further cases of avian influenza have been detected in Victoria since 24 June 2024.\nThings you should know about avian influenza:  \n- Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease that infects chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many species of wild birds, including waterfowl and seabirds can also carry the virus. \n- Movement controls remain in place and infected properties have been quarantined.
