As this flood water moves downstream, river level rises and significant major flooding is expected at Torrumbarry and Barham.\n\nForecasts will be updated as upstream peaks are observed along the along the Goulburn and Campaspe Rivers. \n\nForecasts for Swan Hill and downstream along the Murray River will be provided once there is more certainty in the expected peak at Echuca Wharf.\n\nFlood operations are being conducted by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) at Hume Dam to manage inflows from the upper Murray, Mitta Mitta River and other tributaries. MDBA are working closely with the Bureau and WaterNSW to plan release strategies. \n\nMurray River downstream of Barham to Wentworth: \n- Minor flooding is occurring along the Murray River at Wakool Junction and is possible at Boundary Bend and Wentworth.\n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 9.70 metres around over the weekend, with minor flooding.\n- The Murray River at Boundary Bend is likely to reach the minor flood level (8.00 metres) during Saturday.\n- The Murray River at Wentworth may reach the minor flood level (32.08 m AHD) around 19-22 October. \n\nThis updated Advice message replaces the Advice issued at 4:11pm on Thursday 13/10/2022. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.\n\nConsequences of flooding along the Murray River will vary between NSW and Victoria.
