Water levels are expected to stay high for a few weeks, due to widespread rain over NSW and Victoria and saturated catchment soils.  \n\n- Major flooding is occurring at Wakool Junction. The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 12.00 metres around 13 to 15 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n- Moderate flooding is occurring at Boundary Bend. The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the major flood level (9.00 metres) around Friday 11 November. The river level may reach near 9.10 metres around 15 to 17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n- The Murray River at Euston may exceed the moderate flood level (9.80 metres, 51.60 metresAHD) around 13-16 November. The river level may exceed the major flood level (10.30 metres, 52.10 metres AHD) around 16 to 18 November and reach around 10.40 metres (52.24 metres AHD) around 19 to 22 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible. \n\nSignificant breakout flows from Torrumbarry have spilled into the Wakool River. These flows, combined with floodwaters from the Murray and Edward Rivers, have caused major flooding at Wakool Junction and may cause major flooding downstream at Boundary Bend, Euston (Robinvale), Mildura and Wentworth, with levels higher than the 1975 flood event. Moderate flooding is occurring at Wentworth. \n\nForecasts will be progressively refined once the upstream flood peaks along the Murray River and its tributaries are observed. \n\nSome properties in rural areas may be isolated due to standing water. Aircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area. Emergency services personnel are assessing impacts on affected properties caused by overtopping and levee breeches.\n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers.  The evaluation of potential impacts on critical infrastructure and townships remains a focus. \n\n        Stay safe - avoid the   flooded area. Be aware of potential hazards caused by flooding and never   enter floodwater.

Water levels are expected to stay high for a few weeks, due to widespread rain over NSW and Victoria and saturated catchment soils.\n\n- Moderate flooding is occurring at Swan Hill and Boundary Bend.\n- Major flooding is occurring at Wakool Junction.\n- The Murray River at Swan Hill may peak near the major flood level (4.70 m) during Thursday, with major flooding. \n- This has been revised down from 4.80m and is likely to be below the 1975 flood level.\n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 12.00 metres around 13 to 15 November, with major flooding.\n- Further rises are possible. \n\nAircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area. \n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers.  The evaluation of potential impacts on critical infrastructure and townships remains a focus.\n\nPrepare for flooding now. Take actions to protect your life and property against potential hazards caused by flooding. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"26446","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch & Act","id":"26446","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Watch & Act","location":"Murray River downstream of Benjeroop to Wakool Junction","created":"2022-11-08T20:07:08+11:00","updated":"2022-11-08T20:07:08+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[143.97229962198483,-35.55660804115235]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[144.12682381094595,-35.61687478552818],[144.1200764822459,-35.61493319621956],[144.1199906515622,-35.610066174006896],[144.11005574936968,-35.612456110806654],[144.10505611176706,-35.61990457982136],[144.10982933462572,-35.6348745236368],[144.11745864625001,-35.63994397078432],[144.11746937509898,-35.64754681126483],[144.11249119516725,-35.652498731100295],[144.09970131338596,-35.652451750803344],[144.09729805410828,-35.647430080471985],[144.08751446481594,-35.6449486742149],[144.08742752493745,-35.64240809447247],[144.07738533439033,-35.64254759834613],[144.07506790579632,-35.637525305465005],[144.07017555655725,-35.637525305465005],[144.0700038951809,-35.64003649136027],[144.0576883005674,-35.644983549097425],[144.06017739053777,-35.65258591003871],[144.05507046457157,-35.65746777867227],[144.0524955439175,-35.670054648802505],[144.04511410470812,-35.66991519296968],[144.04502827401544,-35.665103817525925],[144.03241116281427,-35.65516636349508],[144.00236931266173,-35.65510194953841],[143.99498898263815,-35.634938953902356],[143.9822431253935,-35.63246248818173],[143.9695819896647,-35.619944794909024],[143.96254498239372,-35.62000923720818],[143.95996895255388,-35.610315734319144],[143.95001259269043,-35.60752448557496],[143.94997078652545,-35.60256444878766],[143.94499260659373,-35.59991250790012],[143.94490677590107,-35.58996694691631],[143.93507916207213,-35.58750653855545],[143.93503624673028,-35.585046054585995],[143.94239622826876,-35.582463337599044],[143.94248205895244,-35.569984849202974],[143.9374609636789,-35.56504527417285],[143.93256861443982,-35.56501036443155],[143.93014389749118,-35.55755678648587],[143.92510134453775,-35.55500809729573],[143.93252569908898,-35.534964895799014],[143.92250496621276,-35.535087125622134],[143.91750532861013,-35.527491061418175],[143.9101024317298,-35.52754345053058],[143.9023991274386,-35.5125063716172],[143.8951035189129,-35.5125063716172],[143.89497477288737,-35.510095985540815],[143.88006169076309,-35.50997371765241],[143.8801046061049,-35.51248890531122],[143.8749976801387,-35.512523837918636],[143.8723798441428,-35.505082849441536],[143.8674874948948,-35.50501297773785],[143.86727180899976,-35.50250289300201],[143.85489184136452,-35.497588762846206],[143.85285225333362,-35.487688256428136],[143.83733946557348,-35.47260342496653],[143.82995802636407,-35.47256847499868],[143.82502276177416,-35.4675005688995],[143.82013041253512,-35.467605425364766],[143.81993729347886,-35.45000510139144],[143.81700295682572,-35.44698102360831],[143.83085388417211,-35.4431614335022],[143.8319965052092,-35.445093102412905],[143.86212307686858,-35.45603543746479],[143.8691397356544,-35.46627723336998],[143.8970668959143,-35.48077256307692],[143.908298878079,-35.485312069965644],[143.91547757858703,-35.48840799071947],[143.9359481977937,-35.49249622813304],[143.9608820127942,-35.490801556668025],[143.97942144151042,-35.496060162831924],[143.97946435685228,-35.51640999556581],[143.98414212937314,-35.525264492523604],[144.0057500051925,-35.533576701173224],[144.00525647873442,-35.54963987383026],[144.02768936575674,-35.54420678764811],[144.048546223058,-35.54427662523693],[144.06439382310248,-35.55990465104467],[144.07310563798077,-35.571162971413116],[144.08952075715018,-35.578632735713775],[144.10971242661702,-35.584958801993054],[144.11760884995545,-35.59446877496781],[144.12265140289992,-35.604501007992916],[144.12759628714394,-35.61701433396454],[144.12682381094595,-35.61687478552818]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Immediate","severity":"Moderate","certainty":"Likely","contact":"melanie.ingram@ses.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Execute"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"26442","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch & Act","id":"26442","category1":"Watch and Act","category2":"Met","status":"Moderate","name":"Watch & Act","action":"Avoid the Flooded Area ","statewide":"N","location":"Murray River downstream Barham to Benjeroop","created":"2022-11-08T18:05:58+11:00","updated":"2022-11-08T18:05:59+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><div>This<b>&nbsp;Watch &amp;

Low levels of\ndissolved oxygen are recorded at several locations across northern Victoria and\nin the Murray River. The scale of the current flooding means water quality will\nnot improve quickly. Any fish death event in Victoria should be reported to the\nEPA by calling 1300 372 842.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This message was issued by&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_issuing_agency\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">State Emergency Service</span>.<div><br></div><div><b>The next update is expected by&nbsp;</b><span title=\"warning_next_update\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">09/11/2022 05:30 pm</span><b> or as the situation changes.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Use multiple sources to stay informed:</b></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">www.emergency.vic.gov.au</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001055007-What-is-the-VicEmergency-Hotline-\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency Hotline</a> - freecall 1800 226 226 </li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/230492607-What-is-the-VicEmergency-app-a\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency app</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> (#vicfloods)</li><li>Tune in to ABC Local Radio, commercial and designated community radio stations, or Sky News TV.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><b>Accessibility:</b></div><div>The following services can help you, or someone you know, access information during an emergency.</div><div><ul><li>To access this information in other languages, call the <a href=\"https://www.tisnational.gov.au/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Translating and Interpreting Service</a> on 131 450 (freecall)&nbsp;and ask them to call VicEmergency Hotline.</li><li>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech/communication impairment contact <a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-communications-arts/phone/services-people-disability/accesshub/national-relay-service\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">National Relay Service</a> on 1800 555 677 and ask them to call the VicEmergency Hotline.</li></ul></div></div>","text":"WATCH & ACT - RIVERINE FLOOD - Avoid the Flooded Area \nIncident Location: Murray River downstream Barham to Benjeroop\nIssue Date: Tuesday 08 November 2022, 06:05 pm\nNext Update: Wednesday 09 November 2022, 05:30 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/26442/moreinfo\n\n\nThis Watch &amp; Act is being issued for the Murray River downstream of Barham to Benjeroop.\n\nRainfall over the past several weeks has caused renewed and prolonged flooding along the Murray River and its tributaries. \n\n- The Murray River at Barham peaked at 6.21 metres on Wednesday 26 October and is currently at 6.14 metres and steady, with major flooding. The Murray River at Barham is likely to remain above the major flood level (6.10 metres) through to the end of the week. \n\nSome properties remain isolated due to standing water across many areas. Aircraft (including drones) are being used to determine the extent of water inundation across the area. Emergency services personnel are assessing impacts on affected properties caused by overtopping and levee breeches. \n\nEmergency services are assessing and reinforcing existing levees as required, protecting isolated assets and providing relief to local communities and primary producers.  The evaluation of potential impacts on critical infrastructure and townships remains a focus.\n\nStay safe - avoid the flooded area. Be aware of potential hazards caused by flooding and never enter floodwater.

River levels are falling slowly, with major flooding likely to continue through to the end of the week. \n- At Swan Hill, moderate flooding is occurring, with major flooding similar to the 1975 flood possible around mid November. The Murray River at Swan Hill may peak near the major flood level (4.70 m) during Thursday, with major flooding.\n- At Boundary Bend: The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the major flood level (9.00 metres) around Friday 11 November. The river level may reach near 9.10 metres around 15-17 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- At Euston: The Murray River at Euston may exceed the moderate flood level (9.80 metres, 51.60 metresAHD) around 13-16 November. The river level may exceed the major flood level (10.30 metres, 52.10 metres AHD) around 16-18 November and reach around 10.40 metres (52.24 metres AHD) around 19-22 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- At Mildura: The Murray River at Mildura Weir is likely to exceed the minor flood level (36.00 metres AHD) during Tuesday and exceed the moderate flood level (37.50 metres AHD) around 21-25 November. The river level may exceed the major flood level (38.50 metres AHD) and may reach 38.60 metres AHD around the end of November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- At Wentworth: The Murray River at Wentworth may exceed the major flood level (33.88 m AHD) and reach 34.20 m AHD around the first week of December, with major flooding.\nAlong the Edward River, \n- Moderate flooding continues at Deniliquin, Stevens Weir and Moulamein. \n- At Moulamein the river is approaching a peak near 5.90 meters from the combined flows along the Edward River and Billabong Creek. Renewed rises are likely along the Edward River through mid to late November as upstream Murray River flows arrive. The Edward River at Moulamein is peaking near 5.90 metres, with moderate flooding. Renewed rises are possible from mid to late November onwards.\n- At Deniliquin: Renewed rises are occurring along the Edward River at Deniliquin, where the river level may reach near 9.00 metres around 14-16 November, with moderate flooding.\n- At Stevens Weir: The Edward River at Stevens Weir Downstream is likely to reach around 6.50 metres around 16-18 November, with moderate flooding.\n\nWakool River: \n- Major flooding is occurring at Wakool Junction. The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach near 12.00 metres around 13-15 November, with major flooding. Further rises are possible.\n- Significant breakout flows from Torrumbarry have spilled into the Wakool River. These flows, combined with floodwaters from the Murray and Edward Rivers, have caused major flooding at Wakool Junction and may cause major flooding downstream at Boundary Bend, Euston, Mildura and Wentworth, with levels higher than the 1975 flood event. \n- Forecasts will be progressively refined once upstream flood peaks along the Murray River and its tributaries are observed.\n- Flood operations are being conducted by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) at Hume Dam to manage inflows from the upper Murray, Mitta Mitta River and other tributaries. MDBA are working closely with the Bureau and WaterNSW to plan release strategies. \n\n\n\nStay safe - avoid the flooded area. Be aware of potential hazards caused by flooding and never enter floodwater.
