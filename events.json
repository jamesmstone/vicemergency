Locally destructive winds are expected over Alpine areas tonight.\n- A deep, complex low-pressure system well to the south extends a cold front which will approach Victoria later today and cross the State early Wednesday.\n- This, combined with a persistent belt of high pressure across central Australia will result in a strengthening northwesterly gradient across the State during the day.\n- A vigorous westerly airstream will extend across the State with and following the front on Wednesday, easing as the front moves well east of the State on Wednesday night.\n\n\nFor lower elevation areas, including Melbourne overnight:\n- Damaging winds ahead of the front averaging 60 to 70km/h with gusts to 100km/h over all elevated parts of the warning area, possibly extending southwards to adjacent lower elevations including parts of Melbourne.\n\n\nFor elevated and Alpine areas overnight:\n- Destructive winds, averaging around 65 to 80 km/h with gusts up to 130km/h are possible over Alpine peaks overnight tonight with gusts up to 110km/h across remaining areas above 1000m over eastern Victoria.\n- Winds should ease to average 50 to 60km/h with gusts to 100km/h following the frontal passage early Wednesday and damaging winds are likely to become confined to southern peaks by Wednesday afternoon. \n\n\nFor coastal areas:\n- Damaging winds averaging 50 to 60km/h with gusts to 100km/h are possible with and following the cold front over the far southwest coast from this evening, extending eastwards with the front and most likely affecting coastal and elevated areas throughout the night.\n- Squally showers on the front may pose the strongest risk, further squally showers will follow the cold front. \n\n\nFor southern Victoria, including parts of Melbourne on Wednesday:\n- From late Wednesday morning winds strengthening to average 60 to 70km/h with gusts to 100km/h across much of the south and west with the risk of gusts to 110km/h impacting coastal locations, mostly with the chance of thunderstorms across the most southern coasts.\n- Winds are expected to rapidly ease inland in the evening then contract to the Gippsland coast by Wednesday night. \n\n\nLocations which may be affected include Horsham, Warrnambool, Ballarat, Geelong, Melbourne, Traralgon and Bairnsdale. \n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has also issued a Coastal Hazard Warning for people in parts of Central, East Gippsland, South West and West and South Gippsland Forecast Districts.\n- Damaging surf conditions are forecast along the South West and about the exposed Bass and Wilsons Promontory coasts on Wednesday. These conditions may produce localised damage and coastal erosion.\n- Beach conditions in these areas will be dangerous and people should stay well away from the surf and surf exposed area. \n- Abnormally high tides which may cause sea water flooding of low lying areas are likely along the Gippsland coast on the afternoon high tide on Wednesday. \n- At Lakes Entrance, water levels may exceed the highest tide of the year by 0.3-0.5m during Wednesday afternoon's high tide.\n- Water levels around other parts of Victoria, including Port Phillip, Central and the South West coast, may also exceed the highest tides of the year and lead to minor inundation of low lying coastal areas.\n\n\nLocations which may be affected include Warrnambool, Portland, Nelson, Southbank, Elwood Canal and Lakes Entrance.\n\nStay informed and be aware of potential hazards caused by the severe weather. Hazards include debris, damaged buildings, trees down and fallen power lines.\n\nFor coastal areas, stay informed and be aware of potential hazards. Stay well away from the surf and surf-exposed areas. Never enter floodwater.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"34106","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"34106","category1":"Met","category2":"Severe
