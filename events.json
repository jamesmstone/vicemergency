05:20 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/21536/moreinfo\n\nThis message is being issued for Victoria. \n-   Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) has been found in New      South Wales.  \n- This message is relevant for all beekeepers,      associated beekeeping businesses and orchard owners.   \n- Restrictions are now in place for the movement of bees,      beehives, beekeeping equipment and bee products.  \n- Victoria is currently free from Varroa mite.  \n- An Order declaring Victoria as a Control Area is now in      place to prevent Varroa mite from coming into Victoria from NSW.  \n- This Community Information message replaces the      previous message issued on Wednesday 24 August.  \n- To view a map of the Sunraysia region, visit: <a href=\"https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/pest-insects-and-mites/priority-pest-insects-and-mites/varroa-mite-of-honey-bees/varroa-mite-current-situation\" title=\"here\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n- As of midnight Tuesday 23 August you must have      a permit to bring bees, hives, queen bees, used beekeeping equipment and      bee products including pollen and honeycomb into any part of Victoria from      any state or territory.   \n\n\n-   Victorian beekeepers with hives in Victoria must have a      permit to bring bees, beehives, beekeeping equipment and bee products into      Victoria’s Sunraysia region. \n- Check your hives regularly for signs of Varroa mite and      other exotic pests.  \n- Victorian registered beekeepers will be able to move      their hives out of Sunraysia to other parts of the state without a permit      provided they are registered on <a href=\"https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/livestock-and-animals/honey-bees/beekeeper-registration-and-hive-disposal\" title=\"BeeMax\" target=\"_blank\">BeeMax</a>.\n- Existing health certification requirements for moving      bees, hives, used beekeeping equipment and bee products into Victoria      still apply.  \n- For more information and to apply for a permit, visit <a
