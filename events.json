The entire Gippsland Lakes system and Ninety Mile Beach is now safe for recreational contact with water.\n- However as toxins from the algae can accumulate in seafood after a bloom has dispersed, advice regarding the consumption of specific seafood still applies.\n\n\n- Do not consume crustaceans (such as prawns, crabs and bugs) and shellfish caught inside the Gippsland Lakes or within 10 nautical miles of the shore between Mcloughlins Beach and Marlo.\n- Finfish caught from within the Gippsland Lakes should be rinsed thoroughly in fresh water and the guts and gills removed before cooking or freezing.\n- Ingesting these toxins can lead to serious illness. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxins.\n\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"20924","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"20924","category1":"Env","category2":"Blue Green Algae","name":"Community Information","location":"Gippsland Lakes and the Gippsland Coast from McLoughlins Beach to Marlo","created":"2022-06-30T15:39:07+10:00","updated":"2022-06-30T15:39:08+10:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[149.30490948761496,-37.72714719418347]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[148.53174664581474,-37.79723674471629],[148.53380658233974,-37.91217341839337],[148.76932599151795,-37.950084842712094],[148.88948895539372,-37.89537782790558],[149.13050152863266,-37.89754521626703],[149.3021629055891,-37.914340312129696],[149.4937370022634,-37.87586846102289],[149.64136578644286,-37.81513960534689],[149.788307925117,-37.739701231613616],[149.83499981965122,-37.64570281805174],[149.8858115872265,-37.66799067140058],[149.99498822297184,-37.63972201185072],[150.0780723294152,-37.54069698431928],[149.97370221222522,-37.50420954565485],[149.90778424347843,-37.53634121338759],[149.80616070831888,-37.54178588729455],[149.7306297024613,-37.591314146526],[149.68737103547176,-37.652770422738136],[149.67501141633062,-37.68157754210901],[149.61389996613022,-37.69733519504198],[149.597420473948,-37.72286634896787],[149.55965497101022,-37.72286634896787],[149.49099042023306,-37.75056041491453],[149.48549725617232,-37.76793179392322],[149.45528485382928,-37.76630340043739],[149.2795036038228,-37.782585721696265],[149.27126385773173,-37.786927068398725],[149.24929120147982,-37.779329544316525],[149.20534588898494,-37.776073223497136],[148.97531964386746,-37.77824411998124],[148.8441703518702,-37.781500345174194],[148.7487266262857,-37.791268160077976],[148.73087384308383,-37.806459972512286],[148.70890118683187,-37.79777931940902],[148.6278770169136,-37.80537494666905],[148.62856366241894,-37.804832427768986],[148.53174664581474,-37.79723674471629]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Env","event":"Blue Green Algae","eventCode":"blueGrnAlgae","urgency":"Unknown","severity":"Unknown","certainty":"Observed","contact":"jemma.nesbit-sackville@delwp.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning","responseType":"None"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"20925","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"20925","category1":"Community Update","category2":"Env","status":"Unknown","name":"Community Information","action":null,"statewide":"N","location":"Coast Marlo to the Victoria-New South Wales Border","created":"2022-06-30T15:38:03+10:00","updated":"2022-06-30T15:38:03+10:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>message</b> is being issued for coastal water from Marlo to the Victoria-New South Wales Border.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br><div><ul><li>The levels of blue green algae within the Gippsland Lakes have decreased to below safe contact thresholds.
