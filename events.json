Severe heat      is more dangerous for people over 65 years old, the very young and those      with a pre-existing medical condition.  Continuous high temperatures during the day, and no      relief overnight, can stop the body from cooling down normally. It can      cause heat illness and even heatstroke, which is life-threatening.\n\nBack-to-back days of extreme heat, coupled with high overnight temperatures, can interfere with your body’s natural ability to cool down and can cause heat illness, including cramps and heat exhaustion. If left untreated, this can lead to heatstroke, which is a life-threatening illness.\n\nPrepare now to stay safe in the heat. Be aware of the risk of heat-related health problems and plan ahead to keep yourself and others safe.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"40533","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"40533","category1":"Met","category2":"Extreme Heat","name":"Advice","location":"State of Victoria","created":"2026-01-24T18:41:43+11:00","updated":"2026-01-24T18:41:43+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[140.9693,-33.9972],[141.5445,-34.2002],[142.1487,-34.1488],[142.5501,-34.7627],[142.782,-34.5798],[143.3365,-34.7934],[143.3888,-35.1863],[144.7711,-36.1192],[144.9579,-36.08],[145.0718,-35.8332],[146.899,-36.0855],[147.8509,-35.9816],[148.1901,-36.5766],[148.1205,-36.7563],[149.9765,-37.5053],[149.6966,-37.4884],[149.7,-37.6472],[149.4107,-37.7732],[147.7882,-37.9553],[146.8831,-38.6346],[146.1886,-38.7312],[146.2926,-38.9046],[146.4443,-38.7779],[146.4253,-39.0835],[146.1696,-38.8151],[145.9935,-38.8859],[145.372,-38.5363],[145.5348,-38.3979],[145.4418,-38.2187],[144.9363,-38.4942],[144.6779,-38.3197],[144.8871,-38.3593],[145.1123,-38.1521],[144.8744,-37.8636],[144.4127,-38.0842],[144.6922,-38.12],[144.6149,-38.2835],[143.5346,-38.8544],[142.4044,-38.3626],[141.7036,-38.2593],[141.5262,-38.4231],[141.0285,-38.0716],[140.972,-37.7308],[140.9693,-33.9972]]]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[146.96999043724966,-37.300600535174766]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[147.21424557776928,-37.41892896850675],[147.1950575012961,-37.366514016402505],[147.18922101450963,-37.33294443075905],[147.15763532114693,-37.31164862428059],[147.11506329965374,-37.26794603629533],[147.04296552134085,-37.26466731896447],[147.06150495004812,-37.232418995630496],[146.999020208837,-37.12245250672056],[147.01412641000852,-37.08357037706941],[146.9907804627459,-37.0545326811406],[146.9047065874339,-37.003656753535736],[146.86855756235408,-37.01616397196174],[146.83216535044497,-37.029321141891685],[146.7909666199715,-37.04028370943875],[146.72573529673005,-37.06138219612175],[146.74152814340684,-37.077818509097064],[146.75938092660877,-37.08548756941442],[146.7532011170427,-37.11177559998924],[146.777920355325,-37.17307885711431],[146.78547345590178,-37.223124544831265],[146.80033647025297,-37.27296734966199],[146.83741532766746,-37.30792911824589],[146.8978401323625,-37.35815819177958],[146.9489093919978,-37.39904376199055],[146.95904948319938,-37.48111487762811],[146.99043713997528,-37.52733005581363],[147.06287824104982,-37.555369266125886],[147.16072522591196,-37.59754431681379],[147.21188031624894,-37.58094924425714],[147.21256696175428,-37.514259637591266],[147.19128095100768,-37.480756241342085],[147.21424557776928,-37.41892896850675]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Fire","event":"Bushfire","eventCode":"bushFire","urgency":"Immediate","severity":"Moderate","certainty":"Likely","contact":"megan.cain@deeca.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Forest Fire Management Victoria","responseType":"Execute"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"40517","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch & Act","id":"40517","category1":"Watch and Act","category2":"Fire","status":"Moderate","name":"Watch & Act","action":"Monitor Conditions As They Are Changing","statewide":"N","location":"Billabong, Black Snake Creek, Budgee Budgee, Castleburn, Crooked River, Gibbs, Grant, Hawkhurst, Hogtown, Howittville, Maguires, Miowera, Naarun, Peter the Swede, Selwyn, Shepherdson, Talbotville, Waterford, Winchester, Wongungarra, Wonnangatta, Abbeyard, Arbuckle, Cobbannah, Cowa, Dargo, Howitt Plains, Moornapa, Moroka, Toolome","created":"2026-01-24T12:55:21+11:00","updated":"2026-01-24T12:55:36+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Watch and Act </b>message is being issued for&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_locality\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Abbeyard, Arbuckle, Billabong, Black Snake Creek, Budgee Budgee, Castleburn, Cobbannah, Cowa, Crooked River, Dargo, Gibbs, Grant, Hawkhurst, Hogtown, Howitt Plains, Howittville, Maguires, Miowera, Moornapa, Moroka, Naarun, Peter the Swede, Selwyn, Shepherdson, Talbotville, Toolome, Waterford, Winchester, Wongungarra, Wonnangatta</span>.<div><ul><li>There are bushfires in the Wonnangatta Valley (known as the&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_incident_location\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Wonnangatta - Dargo Complex</span>) that are&nbsp;<span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[under control/not yet under control]\" data-value=\"1\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;under control&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;not yet under control&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">not yet under control</span>.</li><li>Fire activity remains in the area.
