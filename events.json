recent rainfall.\n- Widespread rainfall totals of 25-60mm are likely in the metropolitan Melbourne catchments of the Flood Watch on Sunday into Monday. \n- Isolated totals of 60-80mm are possible due

This will bring widespread rainfall in the Flood Watch area and is likely to cause minor flooding, with isolated moderate flooding from Monday morning.\n\nCatchments are moderately wet following recent rainfall.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 30 to 60 mm are likely in the western catchments of Flood Watch area on Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals of 60-80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 60 to 100 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area from late Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nShowers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.\n\nRiver level rises and widespread minor flooding with isolated moderate flooding is likely to develop from Monday morning for parts of the Flood Watch catchments. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and

Isolated totals of 60-80 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 60 to 100 mm are likely across north central and north eastern catchments of the Flood Watch area from late Sunday into Monday. Isolated totals over 100 mm are possible due to heavy falls from thunderstorms.\n\nShowers are expected to gradually contract to the east of the state during Tuesday.  \n\nRiver level rises and
