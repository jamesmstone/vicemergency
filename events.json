Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31562","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"31562","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Yarra River to Coldstream","created":"2023-12-24T16:01:09+11:00","updated":"2023-12-24T16:01:07+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[143.27289800468924,-36.48076505707175]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[142.4846289617175,-35.423063830350976],[142.01221685234142,-36.27349398750815],[141.9902441960985,-36.83389629959534],[144.50062017265466,-37.53846628379253],[144.55555181328,-37.18919103254779],[143.44593267266083,-36.42392112116199],[143.48438482109498,-35.98954964690899],[142.4846289617175,-35.423063830350976]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Thunderstorm","eventCode":"thunderstorm","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"jack.sampson@emv.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31557","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"31557","category1":"Advice","category2":"Met","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Stay Informed","statewide":"N","location":"Horsham, Warracknabeal, St Arnaud, Castlemaine, Kyneton, Daylesford and surrounds","created":"2023-12-24T15:18:30+11:00","updated":"2023-12-24T15:18:30+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a <b>Severe Thunderstorm\nWarning</b> for <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[location]\" data-value=\"Horsham, Warracknabeal, St Arnaud, Castlemaine, Kyneton, Daylesford and surrounds\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Horsham, Warracknabeal, St Arnaud, Castlemaine, Kyneton, Daylesford and surrounds</span>.<div><br><div><ul><li>Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours.</li><li>An upper trough and a moist air mass are generating severe thunderstorms this afternoon and into the evening.</li></ul></div></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Be\naware of potential hazards caused by the <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[severe thunderstorm / severe thunderstorms]\" data-value=\"0\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;severe thunderstorm&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;severe thunderstorms&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">severe thunderstorm</span>,\nincluding <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[insert hazards - e.g.: floodwater, debris, damaged building, trees down, fallen power lines]\" data-value=\"floodwater, debris and damaged buildings.\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">floodwater, debris and damaged buildings.</span></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><b>What you should do:&nbsp;</b><div><div><ul><li>Park your car\nundercover and away from trees.</li><li>Large hail is expected.

Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday. \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.       \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include:  \n\nBemm, Cann and Genoa Rivers \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.    \n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.    \n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening. Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.    \n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday.    \n\nPlease note that some flood class levels have been updated on the Snowy, Genoa, Mitchell and Buchan Rivers. Please refer to Victorian Flood Class Levels South of Divide (http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/flood/ floodclass_south.shtml) for the current flood class levels.    \n\nCatchments likely to be affected include: \nAvon River \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.

This will linger over the state on Monday and is expected to produce moderate to heavy rainfall with thunderstorms. A surface low is expected to move slowly northward and then eastwards into the Tasman Sea during late Tuesday (Boxing Day). Showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually contract to the east of the State during Tuesday.\n\nCatchments across Western and North Central Victoria are dry, while catchments across East and North East Victoria are moderately wet.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10 to 40mm are expected in the warning areas during Sunday evening and Monday (Christmas Day), with isolated heavier falls of 70 to 80mm possible. The heaviest falls are more likely to be experienced with thunderstorms in the late Monday afternoon and evening . Rain will move over North East and Eastern catchments on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough catchments in Western, North Western and Central areas are dry, river level rises are likely in the areas of heaviest rainfall. Catchments are relatively wet in parts of Gippsland and the North East and may respond quickly to rainfall. Isolated minor flooding may develop at some locations, particularly in the upper parts of the catchments in the flood watch area from Monday afternoon and during Tuesday. \n\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31558","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"31558","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Bunyip River and Dandenong Creek","created":"2023-12-24T15:54:04+11:00","updated":"2023-12-24T15:54:02+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[142.8560648152379,-37.72353647657128]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[142.8621587941158,-37.698893103860776],[142.86610700578055,-37.697195277555814],[142.87391759843527,-37.700794623161876],[142.87898160905968,-37.70554820802176],[142.87589170427665,-37.71315330969038],[142.87906743974335,-37.71933188010459],[142.87941076250502,-37.72747865773398],[142.879153270436,-37.730058283844485],[142.88069822283202,-37.73494575004419],[142.87211515397928,-37.74519480498057],[142.8584680745111,-37.74987767558676],[142.84507848711195,-37.74811315044005],[142.83452131242683,-37.74329442514279],[142.83143140764375,-37.736031809833634],[142.83314802141612,-37.72883636688745],[142.83726789445717,-37.72333749108105],[142.8419885823199,-37.719942919508796],[142.8571806141841,-37.72062184626787],[142.86224462480848,-37.715326052529214],[142.85657979936244,-37.71104840430797],[142.86018468828345,-37.705751926274644],[142.85975553483811,-37.702288639824346],[142.8621587941158,-37.698893103860776]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Env","event":"Blue Green Algae","eventCode":"blueGrnAlgae","urgency":"Unknown","severity":"Unknown","certainty":"Observed","contact":"christine.millington@delwp.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Other Agencies","responseType":"None"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"31401","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"31401","category1":"Community Update","category2":"Env","status":"Unknown","name":"Community Information","action":null,"statewide":"N","location":"Lake Bolac","created":"2023-12-07T13:14:26+11:00","updated":"2023-12-07T13:14:26+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This message is being issued for water quality at Lake Bolac.&nbsp;<div><ul><li>High levels of blue-green algae have been detected in the lake.&nbsp;</li><li>The algal bloom is expected to remain until there is significant rainfall to flush the lake or cooler conditions slow the\nalgae.&nbsp;</li><li>Regular testing is being conducted to identify new outbreaks or changes that might indicate improved water quality.&nbsp;</li><li>This notification will be reviewed weekly and updated as the situation changes. </li></ul></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\"><div>Warning signs have been installed at the lake. </div><div><br></div>You should avoid direct contact with affected water in&nbsp;<span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[location]\" data-value=\"Lake Bolac\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Lake Bolac</span>.<div><br></div><div>Do not swim in affected areas or use water for cooking, drinking, washing or showering.
