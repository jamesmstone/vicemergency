viruses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If left untreated, Varroa mite infested honey bee hives\n     are likely to die within three to four years, which will have a\n     significant impact on Australia's honey

from\n     anywhere in Victoria into the Sunraysia region. Permit applications will\n     be considered from jurisdictions where Varroa is not present and for\n     Victorian-registered beekeepers to bring equipment and supers back from\n     NSW as long as they have not been in a NSW Eradication (red) or delimiting\n     surveillance (purple) zones since 1 January 2022.&nbsp; Applications will also be considered for\n     anyone to bring in honeycomb or pollen for feeding bees from NSW as long\n     as the properties the products originated from are not located in the NSW\n     Eradication (red) zone and delimiting surveillance zone (purple) and can meet\n     specified permit conditions.</li><li>These measures have been made to provide extra care\n     that we conduct this pollination season safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>This does not include processed honey and wax, drone\n     semen, propolis for human consumption and new beekeeping tools and\n     equipment which can be transported within Victoria and from interstate as\n     normal.&nbsp;\n </li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><b>What you should do if you own bees:&nbsp;</b></div><div><ul><li>\n Check your hives regularly for signs of Varroa mite and\n     other exotic pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), is a\n     distinctive-looking small mite, around 1 mm in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Mites are easily identifiable to the naked eye and are\n     a reddish-brown colour.&nbsp;</li><li>Varroa mite can be tested for using any of the\n     following methods:&nbsp; sugar shake, alcohol wash test, drone uncapping\n     or brood uncapping inspection.
