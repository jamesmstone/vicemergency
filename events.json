pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/19395/moreinfo\n\nThis Advice message is being issued for Walkerville, Walkerville North, Walkerville South.\n\n- Due to a whale carcass, there could be an increase in shark activity at Walkerville North Beach. \n- A whale carcass can attract sharks to the area and mean they are closer to the shore than normal.\n- While it is not uncommon for sharks to be present off the Victorian coast, you should exercise additional caution in the area.\n- The Victorian Fisheries Authority is assisting Park Rangers with the management of the whale carcass.\n- This Advice message replaces the Advice issued on 22 December.\n\n\nStay informed and do not enter the water at closed beaches.
