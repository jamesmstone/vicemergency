Moderate flooding is continuing at Kialla West.\n\nFurther rainfall is forecast for the Seven and Castle Creek catchments from Sunday evening which may result in renewed river level rises into next week. The situation is being closely monitored, and warnings will be updated as necessary. \n\n\nSeven Creeks downstream of Euroa\n- Moderate flooding is occurring along the Seven Creeks downstream of Euroa.\n- The Seven Creeks at Kialla West is currently at 5.21 metres and steady, with moderate flooding. The Seven Creeks at Kialla West may remain above the moderate flood level (5.00 m) for the remainder of Saturday and into Sunday.\n\n\nUpdated Community information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.   \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree.    \n\nIf you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall.  \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary.

High levels of organic matter have been washed\ninto waterways and, combined with warm weather, can cause oxygen levels in the\nwater to drop. This can harm or cause the death of fish and crayfish. River\nmanagers and scientists monitor rivers for water quality issues and work to\nreduce the impacts of a blackwater event where they can. Low levels of\ndissolved oxygen are recorded at several locations across northern Victoria and\nin the Murray River. The scale of the current flooding means water quality will\nnot improve quickly. Any fish death event in Victoria should be reported to the\nEPA by calling 1300 372 842. </div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><div>This message was issued\nby <span title=\"warning_issuing_agency\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">State Emergency Service</span>.</div><div><b>The\nnext update is expected by <span title=\"warning_next_update\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">29/10/2022 05:30 pm</span>&nbsp;or as the situation changes.</b></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Use multiple sources to stay informed:</b></div></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">www.emergency.vic.gov.au</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001055007-What-is-the-VicEmergency-Hotline-\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency Hotline</a>&nbsp;- freecall 1800 226 226</li><li><a href=\"https://vicemergency.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/230492607-What-is-the-VicEmergency-app-a\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">VicEmergency app</a></li><li><a href=\"https://facebook.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicemergency\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> (#vicfloods)</li><li>Tune in to ABC Local Radio, commercial and designated community radio stations, or Sky News TV.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><b>Accessibility:&nbsp;</b></div><div>The following services can help you, or someone you know, access information during an emergency.&nbsp; </div><div><ul><li>To access this information in other languages call the <a href=\"https://www.tisnational.gov.au/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Translating and Interpreting Service</a> on 131 450 (freecall) and ask them to call VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech/communication impairment contact <a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-technology-communications/phone/services-people-with-disability/accesshub/national-relay-service\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">National Relay Service</a> on 1800 555 677 and ask them to call the VicEmergency Hotline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>","text":"ADVICE - RIVERINE FLOOD - Stay Informed\nIncident Location: Murray River downstream of Barham to Wentworth\nIssue Date: Friday 28 October 2022, 05:39 pm\nNext Update: Saturday 29 October 2022, 05:30 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/25318/moreinfo\n\n\nThis Minor Flood Warning is being issued for Murray River downstream of Barham to Wentworth.\n\nFloodwaters from the Campaspe and Goulburn Rivers combined with flows down the Murray River have caused major flooding at Echuca and Moama where the river level peaked around 94.98m AHD Wednesday night with major flooding, higher than the October 1993 (94.77m AHD) and November 1975 (94.80m AHD) flood peaks. \n\nMajor flooding is possible along the Murray River at Swan Hill. Moderate flooding is occurring at Wakool Junction. Minor flooding is occurring at Boundary Bend and Wentworth, with moderate flooding possible. Minor flooding is possible at Euston. Moderate flooding may occur at Mildura. \n\n- The Murray River at Swan Hill is likely to exceed the minor flood level (4.50m) over the weekend and may reach the major flood level (4.70m) during the second week of November (8 to 11 November). This is similar to the October 1993 flood event.\n- The Murray River at Wakool Junction may reach around 11.40m 20 to 23 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Boundary Bend may exceed the moderate flood level (8.50m) over the weekend. The river level may reach around 8.70m 24 to 26 November, with moderate flooding.\n- The Murray River at Euston may exceed the minor flood level (9.10m) in mid November. The river level may reach around 9.50m 25 to 27 November, with minor flooding.\n- The Murray River at Mildura Weir may exceed the minor flood level (36.00m AHD) around 10 to 12 November. The river level may reach 37.50m AHD round the end of November, with moderate flooding, similar to the 1993 flood. \n\nFurther rainfall is forecast for the reminder of Friday across parts of the Murray River Basin and another trough may bring showers and thunderstorm during Monday and Tuesday, which may cause renewed river level rises and flooding. The situation is being closely monitored and revised predictions will be provided if necessary. \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert.\n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25318","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25318","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine

Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  Never park, take shelter or camp under a tree. \n\nIf you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT! \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon.\n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.\n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if

The situation is being closely monitored, and warnings will be updated as necessary. \n\nAcheron River:\nMinor flooding is occurring along the Acheron River.\n\nThe Acheron River at Taggerty peaked around the moderate flood level (2.60 m) overnight Friday into Saturday and is currently at 2.51 metres and falling, with minor flooding. The Acheron River at Taggerty is likely to remain above the minor flood level (2.30 m) during Saturday and into Sunday. \n\nUpdated Community information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.    \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.  If it gets windy, trees will become more unstable and deadly.  \n\nNever park, take shelter or camp under a tree.     If you are planning to camp close to rivers or creeks DONT!     \n\nUnexpected river rises are very likely after even small amounts of rainfall and ongoing water releases from Lake Eildon.    \n\nStay informed - monitor your local conditions and remain alert. Never enter floodwater.    \n\nIn the VicEmergency App, add a watch zone for your campsite and regularly check emergency broadcasters via car radio if necessary. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25383","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"25383","category1":"Met","category2":"Riverine Flood","name":"Advice","location":"Acheron River","created":"2022-10-29T11:39:16+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T11:39:16+11:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.63933068983016,-36.05550236537429]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[144.62774354688256,-36.0604986542324],[144.62722856275354,-36.05772319821723],[144.62611276380284,-36.05612726668215],[144.62508279554484,-36.05217199251807],[144.62602693311018,-36.05154745737398],[144.62800103895154,-36.05140867111409],[144.62988931409123,-36.05092291727524],[144.63194925061626,-36.04863289451771],[144.6328933881906,-36.048147123550216],[144.637442414677,-36.047591953059175],[144.638472382944,-36.05015958375889],[144.6419056104797,-36.055780320761215],[144.6453388380244,-36.056821153935424],[144.6454246687081,-36.05661298840198],[144.64576799146076,-36.05661298840198],[144.6462829755898,-36.055988488497164],[144.64611131421344,-36.05196381468754],[144.6474846052331,-36.050784129914156],[144.65023118726347,-36.05140867111409],[144.65254861584853,-36.052796522706004],[144.65357858411548,-36.05404556821551],[144.65306359998652,-36.057306871371864],[144.65340692273918,-36.05945786969867],[144.65211946241217,-36.0634127776894],[144.62774354688256,-36.0604986542324]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Met","event":"Riverine Flood","eventCode":"riverineflod","urgency":"Immediate","severity":"Moderate","certainty":"Likely","contact":"janene.charman@delwp.vic.gov.au","senderName":"State Emergency Service","responseType":"Execute"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"25362","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Watch & Act","id":"25362","category1":"Watch and Act","category2":"Met","status":"Moderate","name":"Watch & Act","action":"Move to Higher Ground","statewide":"N","location":"Wharparilla","created":"2022-10-29T11:17:20+11:00","updated":"2022-10-29T11:17:21+11:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Major Flood Warning</b> is being issued\nfor <span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"text\" data-emptytext=\"[sub-catchment]\" data-value=\"Wharparilla.\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">Wharparilla.</span><br><div><br></div><div>Flooding has impacted residents in the area of O'Dwyer Road, Wharparilla.&nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div>Flooding is expected to remain at current levels for the next week.</div><div><br></div><div>The latest Community Newsletter from Saturday 29 October is available here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://files-em.em.vic.gov.au/public/CommNews/Community-Newletters/Community_Newsletter_29_October_2022_Final_.pdf?v=202210291105\" title=\"Community Newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">Community Newsletter</a></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\"><b>Move to higher ground.

The situation is being closely monitored, and warnings will be updated as necessary. \n\nCastle Creek:\nRiver levels are easing along the Castle Creek and expected to remain below the minor flood level at Telfords Bridge over the remainder of the weekend. \n\nUpdated Community information: \nIn flood-affected areas, there are now many cases of gastro (gastroenteritis, diarrhoea) causing people to get very sick.   \n\nTo prevent gastro always wash your hands after going to the toilet, before eating, preparing food, or cleaning your teeth etc. Only drink and wash, or wash clothes in known clean water.    \n\nAvoid contact with floodwaters to prevent illness. Floodwaters may contain sewage and other toxic waste and can also overflow into your home.  Contact with sewage can make people sick, so clean and disinfect any impacted areas.  \n\nThe wet ground conditions have resulted in many trees falling without warning.
