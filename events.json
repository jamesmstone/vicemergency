If you suspect your birds are sick you should contact your local vet or call the VicEmergency Hotline 1800 226 226. \n\n","sizeFmt":null,"incidentFeatures":[{"properties":{"feedType":"incident","sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"34282","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Community Information","id":"34282","category1":"Env","category2":"Animal Disease","name":"Community Information","location":"Terang and surrounds","created":"2024-09-12T08:03:44+10:00","updated":"2024-09-12T08:03:45+10:00","webHeadline":null,"sizeFmt":null}}]}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.50057961549822,-38.282456360069716]},{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[144.52577092256772,-38.27326011078423],[144.51667286958593,-38.27487727794662],[144.50946309175288,-38.27730296116363],[144.50474240389016,-38.28107608509847],[144.5024249753051,-38.284646896780934],[144.5042274197611,-38.289228058293304],[144.5045707425138,-38.29259637493489],[144.49847676363137,-38.293943657817856],[144.48955037202595,-38.29178799319862],[144.48002316560783,-38.290238569700705],[144.47538830842876,-38.28990173412869],[144.47658993807212,-38.28754384134829],[144.4846580227869,-38.28761121077625],[144.49058034029292,-38.28855437620535],[144.49478604402668,-38.28943016170037],[144.4978759488097,-38.289228058293304],[144.49547268953202,-38.28626381033115],[144.4951293667793,-38.28404054491384],[144.494185229205,-38.282558330137846],[144.4978759488097,-38.282086709999156],[144.50070836153273,-38.2808065827484],[144.5028541287414,-38.277976747675815],[144.5058582028408,-38.27575322845612],[144.51152302827788,-38.27326011078423],[144.5189044674873,-38.271710291792346],[144.52517010774605,-38.270969062321576],[144.52577092256772,-38.27326011078423]]]}]},"properties":{"feedType":"warning","cap":{"category":"Env","event":"Dangerous Animal","eventCode":"animalDanger","urgency":"Expected","severity":"Minor","certainty":"Unknown","contact":"max.x.o'callaghan@emv.vic.gov.au","senderName":"Other Agencies","responseType":"Monitor"},"sourceOrg":"EMV","sourceId":"34302","sourceFeed":"cop-cap","sourceTitle":"Advice","id":"34302","category1":"Advice","category2":"Env","status":"Minor","name":"Advice","action":"Avoid the Area","statewide":"N","location":"Thirteenth Beach, Barwon Heads","created":"2024-09-19T14:01:11+10:00","updated":"2024-09-19T14:01:12+10:00","webHeadline":null,"webBody":"<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">This <b>Advice </b>message is being issued for&nbsp;<span title=\"warning_locality\" class=\"param\" contenteditable=\"false\">Thirteenth Beach, Barwon Heads</span>.<div><ul><li>An increase in shark activity has been reported at Thirteenth Beach, Barwon Heads, near Barwon Bluff due to a whale carcass.</li><li>A&nbsp;<span class=\"editable editable-click editable-unsaved\" data-type=\"select\" data-emptytext=\"[whale carcass / whale stranding]\" data-value=\"0\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"display: inline;\" data-source=\"{&quot;0&quot;:&quot;whale carcass&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;whale stranding&quot;}\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">whale carcass</span>&nbsp;can attract sharks\nto the area and mean they are closer to the shore than normal.</li><li>While it is not uncommon for sharks to be\npresent off the Victorian coast, you should exercise additional caution in the\narea. </li><li>This Advice replaces the Advice issued at 9:19pm Thursday 12 September.</li></ul></div></div><div style=\"font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom:20px\">Avoid the area.
