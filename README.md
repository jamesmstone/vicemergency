Tracking emergency data from https://emergency.vic.gov.au/

This repo archives the latest version of https://emergency.vic.gov.au/public/events-geojson.json every twenty minutes, if it has changed.

Inspired by this project: [Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)


You can view the db from the [`db`](https://github.com/jamesmstone/vicemergency/tree/db) branch
