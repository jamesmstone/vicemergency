        "text": "ADVICE - EXTREME HEAT  - Prepare Now\nIncident Location: State of Victoria\nIssue Date: Thursday 08 January 2026, 05:21 pm\nNext Update: Friday 09 January 2026, 06:30 pm\n\nMore details at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/#!/warning/39070/moreinfo\n\nThis Advice message is being issued for extreme heat across the State of Victoria.\n- Severe to extreme intensity heatwave conditions are occurring until Saturday 10 January. \n- Conditions will intensify and peak on Friday. \n- There will be little to no relief from high temperatures overnight.\n- Conditions will progressively ease from the southwest over the weekend.\n\nFrom Friday:\n- Extreme intensity heat will impact a large area of the north and east of the state.\n- Impacted locations include Seymour, Shepparton, Tatura, Benalla, Mansfield, Wangaratta, Beechworth, Rutherglen, Albury-Wodonga, Corryong, Mount Buller, Falls Creek, Mount Hotham, Omeo, Lake Mountain, Mount Baw Baw, Latrobe Valley, Sale, Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Orbost, Mallacoota.\n- Severe intensity heat will continue to impact the rest of the state, including Melbourne.\n- Maximum temperatures will significantly increase. \n\nFrom Saturday:\n- Extreme intensity heat will decrease to smaller parts of North East and East Gippsland districts.\n- Impacted locations include Corryong, Alpine areas and Mallacoota.\n- Severe intensity heat will also decrease to parts of Northern Country, North East, West and South Gippsland and East Gippsland districts.\n- These areas include Benalla, Shepparton, Albury-Wodonga, Beechworth, Wangaratta, Rutherglen, Falls Creek, Mount Hotham, Mount Baw Baw, Omeo and Bairnsdale.\n\nFrom Sunday\n- The heat will have mostly left the state, with only very small areas in North East and East Gippsland districts experiencing a low intensity heatwave.  \n\n\n- Extreme heat can make anyone sick.\n- Severe heat is more dangerous for people over 65 years old, the very young and those with a pre-existing medical condition.\n- Continuous high temperatures during the day, and no relief overnight, can stop the body from cooling down normally. It can cause heat illness and even heatstroke, which is life-threatening.\n- This Advice message replaces the Advice message issued at 5:55pm Wednesday 7 January. \n\n\nPrepare now to stay safe in the heat. Be aware of the risk of heat-related health problems and plan ahead to keep yourself and others safe.\n\n",
